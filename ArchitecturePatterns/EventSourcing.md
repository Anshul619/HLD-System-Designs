# Event Sourcing
- [Event sourcing](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html) persists the state of a business entity such an Order or a Customer as a sequence of state-changing events.
- Whenever the state of a business entity changes, a new event is appended to the list of events.
