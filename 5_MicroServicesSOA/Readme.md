# Microservices design
- [Microservices](https://microservices.io/index.html) are a modern [Service-Oriented Architecture](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/service-oriented-architecture/).
- In a Microservice Architecture, each service is self-contained and implements a single business capability.
- Microservice architecture makes it easier and fastest way to build and work on individual parts of an application, and thus the application as a whole.
- Example - User Management, Order Management, Checkout, Address etc.

# :thumbsup: Advantages of Microservices design

| Title                                         | Remarks                                                                                                     |

| :star: Separation of Concern, loosely coupled | Each service can be scaled independently and would have its team which owns the microservice.               |
| Scalability                                   | Scalability would become easy.                                                                              |
| :sunglasses: Engineering                      | Dedicated data store & own programming language for each microservice.                                      |
| rocket: Deployment becomes independent & fast | Deployment becomes easy, independent & fast.<br/>- A large monolithic code can take up to 1 day, to deploy. |

# :thumbsdown: Disadvantages of Microservices design

| Title                       | Remarks                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :family_man_woman_boy: Team | Monolithic is good for small team while Microservice is good for large team.                              |
| :moneybag: Increased Budget | With microservices, the budget increases (deployment, time to make change, team size etc.)                |
| Obviousness                 | With large number of services, it would be a bit tricky to find the microservice for the required change. |
| Increased Complexity        | Wide variety of resources, exponential complexity increase.                                               |
| Safety                      | The contract should be defined properly between microservices.                                            |
| Resilience                  | Client should be able to handle failure scenarios properly.                                               |
| Dependency                  | Micro-services would be dependent to each other. Sometimes, there can be circular dependencies also.      |
