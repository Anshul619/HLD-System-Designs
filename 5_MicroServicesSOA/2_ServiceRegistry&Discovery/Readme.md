# Service Registry and Discovery
- One of the primary challenges with [microservices architectures](../Readme.md) is allowing services to discover and interact with each other. 
- The distributed characteristics of [microservices architectures](../Readme.md) not only make it harder for services to communicate, but also presents other challenges, such as checking the health of those systems and announcing when new applications become available. 
- You also must decide how and where to store meta-store information, such as configuration data, that can be used by applications.
