# Data Lake
- A [data lake](https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/what-is-a-data-lake/) is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. 
- You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analyticsâ€”from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.
