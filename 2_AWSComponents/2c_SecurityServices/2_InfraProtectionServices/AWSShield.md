# AWS Shield
- [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield) is a [managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. 
- [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield) provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that [minimize application downtime and latency](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/Scalability/LatencyThroughput.md), so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection. 

There are two tiers of AWS Shield 
- AWS Shield Standard (enabled by default and comes with no additional cost)
- [AWS Shield Advanced](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/features/)

# Pricing - Consolidated Accounts
- If your organization has multiple AWS accounts, then you can subscribe multiple AWS Accounts to [AWS Shield Advanced]() by individually enabling it on each account using the AWS Management Console or API. 
- You will pay the monthly fee once as long as the AWS accounts are all under a single consolidated billing, and you own all the AWS accounts and resources in those accounts.
