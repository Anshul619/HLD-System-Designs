# Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL)
- [Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/shared-throughput-kcl-consumers.html) delivers all records for a given partition key to the same record processor, making it easier to build multiple applications reading from the same [Amazon Kinesis data stream]() (for example, to perform counting, aggregation, and filtering).
