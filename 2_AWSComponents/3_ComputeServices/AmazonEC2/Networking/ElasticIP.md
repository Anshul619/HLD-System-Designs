# Elastic IP addresses
- An [Elastic IP address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. 
- An Elastic IP address is allocated to your AWS account, and is yours until you release it.
- You can lose the private IP address you stop and start the instance. Hence Elastic IP needs to be allocated to the instance.
