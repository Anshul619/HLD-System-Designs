# Resource/Connection Pooling Pattern
- DB connections are a pooled resource.
- The pool () manages allocation, reuse, and cleanup.
- A key aspect is lifecycle management â€” detecting dead or idle connections and returning them to the pool.
- Timeout handling here ensures no resource is **checked out** forever.
