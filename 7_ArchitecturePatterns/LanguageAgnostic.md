# Language Agnostic
- [Language Agnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-agnostic) programming or scripting (also called language-neutral, language-independent, or cross-language) is a software development paradigm where a particular language is chosen because of its appropriateness for a particular task (taking into consideration all factors, including ecosystem, developer skill-sets, performance, etc.), and not purely because of the skill-set available within a development team.
- We should design the system considering agnostic feature (Language agnostic, AWS agnostic) into the consideration.
