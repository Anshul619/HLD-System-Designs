# Test Driven Development
- [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. 
- It ensures that code is always tested and functional, reducing bugs and improving code quality.

# Key Stages

| Stage                             | Description                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Write a test                      | Create a test case that describes the desired behavior of the code.                                |
| Run the test and watch it fail    | The test will initially fail because the code doesn’t exist yet.                                   |
| Write the code                    | Implement the minimal code necessary to pass the test.                                             |
| Run the test and verify it passes | The test should now pass, ensuring the code meets the desired behavior.                            |
| Refactor the code                 | Improve the code’s structure, readability, and maintainability without changing its functionality. |
