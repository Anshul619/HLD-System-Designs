# Placement groups
- When you launch a new [EC2 instance](../Readme.md), the EC2 service attempts to place the instance in such a way that all of your instances are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures. 
- You can use [placement groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload.

| :star: [Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) | High-performance computing (HPC) applications, which need low-latency network performance for tightly coupled node-2-node communication.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Partition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html)      | Large distributed and replicated workloads, such as [Hadoop](../../../../6_BigData/ApacheHadoop/Readme.md), [Cassandra](../../../../3_Databases/11_WideColumn-Databases/ApacheCasandra.md), [Kafka](../../../../4_MessageBrokersEDA/Kafka/Readme.md) etc. | Spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions.                                                                                           |
| [Spread](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html)         | Recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures. <br/>- You can have a [maximum of 7 running instances per Availability Zone per group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html). |
