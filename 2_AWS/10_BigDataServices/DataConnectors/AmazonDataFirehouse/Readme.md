# Amazon Data Firehouse
- [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/) is the easiest way to [extract, transform, and load data streams (ETL)](../../../../6_BigData/DataProcessing/ETL.md) into various [data stores](../../../1_DatabaseServices), [data lakes](../../DataStorage/DataLakes) & [analytics services](../../DataConsumption), for near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools.
- It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. 
- It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security.
- You cannot set up multiple consumers for Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams as it can dump data in a single data repository at a time.

> Note
> - When a [Kinesis data stream](../../../4_MessageBrokerServices/AmazonKinesis/Readme.md) is configured as the source of a Firehose delivery stream, [Firehoseâ€™s PutRecord and PutRecordBatch operations](../../../4_MessageBrokerServices/AmazonKinesis/Readme.md) are disabled and Kinesis Agent cannot write to Firehose delivery stream directly.
> - Data needs to be added to the [Kinesis data stream](../../../4_MessageBrokerServices/AmazonKinesis/Readme.md) through the [Kinesis Data Streams PutRecord and PutRecords operations](../../../4_MessageBrokerServices/AmazonKinesis/Readme.md) instead.
