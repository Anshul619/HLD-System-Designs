| Built-in Service Discovery   | [Amazon ECS](../Readme.md) includes [integrated service discovery (DNS based)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html) that makes it easy for your containerized services to discover and connect with each other.<br/>- Services configured to use service discovery have a limit of 1,000 tasks for each service. This is due to a [Route53](../../../16_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/1_EdgeNetworking/AmazonRoute53/Readme.md) service quota. |
| AWS Cloudmap                 | [AWS CloudMap namespace](../../../16_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/2_ApplicationNetworking/AWSCloudMap.md) can also be configured in ECS Service Discovery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Kubernates Service Discovery | You can also use unified service discovery for services managed by Kubernetes. <br/>- To enable this integration, AWS contributed to the External DNS project, a Kubernetes incubator project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

# Service Discovery Key Concepts

| Concept                       | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Service discovery namespace   | A logical group of service discovery services that share the same domain name, such as `example.com`.                                                            |
| Service discovery service     | Exists within the service discovery namespace and consists of the service name and DNS configuration for the namespace.                                          |
| Service discovery instance    | Exists within the service discovery service and consists of the attributes that are associated with each Amazon ECS service in the service directory.            |
| Amazon ECS health checks      | Amazon ECS performs periodic container-level health checks. If an endpoint doesn't pass the health check, it's removed from DNS routing and marked as unhealthy. |
