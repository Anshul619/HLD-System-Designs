# Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is an object store (flat-structure), meaning it is a higher layer data storage system, essentially [it is a database "blob" storage](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32166/blob-storage), storing data in an underlying simple database as an object.
- It's designed for [WRITE once READ many access i.e. append-only data structure](../../../3_Databases/5_DatabaseInternals/AppendOnlyProperty.md), perfect for [Static content](../../../7_Scalability/CDNs/StaticContent.md).
- It's [distributed](../../../7_Scalability) and offers a very high level of redundancy i.e. [data is stored in 3 AZs within a specific region](../../AWS-Global-Architecture-Region-AZ.md).

| Batch Replication                  | [S3 Batch Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-batch-replication-batch.html) provides you a way to replicate objects that existed before a replication configuration was in place, objects that have previously been replicated, and objects that have failed replication.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Object Metadata                    | [Object metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingMetadata.html) is set of name-value pairs with which you can store information regarding the object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Byte Range Fetch                   | Using the Range HTTP header in a GET Object request, you can fetch a byte-range from an object, transferring only the specified portion.<br/>- A byte-range request is a perfect way to get the beginning of a file and ensuring we remain efficient during our scan of our S3 bucket.

- Instead of [directly accessing the S3 resource](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/amazon-s3-amazon-cloudfront-a-match-made-in-the-cloud/), we should use [CloudFront distribution](../../16_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/1_EdgeNetworking/AmazonCloudFront.md) in the middle (which acts as a [CDN](../../../7_Scalability/CDNs/CDNs.md))

# S3 CLI
- It's a best practice to use [aws s3 commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/) for multipart uploads and downloads, because these aws s3 commands automatically perform [multipart uploading and downloading based on the file size](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-multipart-upload-cli).

| Name                 | Command                            | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
