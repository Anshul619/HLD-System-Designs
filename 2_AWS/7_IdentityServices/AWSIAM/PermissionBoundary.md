# Permission Boundary
- A [permissions boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) is an advanced feature that allows you to limit the maximum permissions that a principal can have.
- As the IAM administrator, you can define one or more permissions boundaries using managed policies and allow your employee to create a principal with this boundary.
