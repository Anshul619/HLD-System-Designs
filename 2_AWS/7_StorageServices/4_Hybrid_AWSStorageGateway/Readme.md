| Regional Service           | The Storage Gateway is deployed to a selected AWS Region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Standard Storage Protocols | All Storage Gateway types use standard storage protocols, local caching, and secure and optimized data transfers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Fully Managed Cache        | The local gateway appliance maintains a cache of recently written or read data so your applications can have low-latency access to data that is stored durably in AWS. <br/>- The gateways use a read-through and write-back cache, committing data locally, acknowledging the write operations, and then asynchronously copying data to AWS, reducing application latency. |
| Local Cache - Limit        | Associate a disk size for the local cache of at least 150 GiB. <br/>- The maximum supported size of the local cache for a gateway running on a VM is 64 TiB. <br/>- You can configure one or more local drives for your cache, up to the maximum capacity.                                                                                                                  |
| Security                   | [AWS Storage Gateway]() supports authentication between your gateway and iSCSI initiators by using [CHAP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/vgw/GettingStartedConfigureChap.html).                                                                                                                                                                          |
