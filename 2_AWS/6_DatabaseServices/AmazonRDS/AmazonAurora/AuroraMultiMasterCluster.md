# Aurora Multi-Master Cluster
- In a [multi-master cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-multi-master.html), all DB instances can perform write operations. 
- There isn't any failover when a writer DB instance becomes unavailable, because another writer DB instance is immediately available to take over the work of the failed instance.

# :thumbsdown: Limitations with Aurora Multi-master clusters
