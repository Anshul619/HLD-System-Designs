# Blue Green Deployment in RDS
- [Blue-green deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments.html) can be used to test any changes like upgrade, schema, data etc. in RDS.
- It uses [WAL/bin-logs](../../../../3_Databases/5_DatabaseInternals/WAL&BinLog.md) for replication.
