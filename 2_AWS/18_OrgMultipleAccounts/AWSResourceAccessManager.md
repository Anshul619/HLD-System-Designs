# AWS Resource Access Manager
- [AWS RAM](https://aws.amazon.com/ram/) helps you securely share your resources across AWS accounts, within your organization or organizational units (OUs), and with IAM roles and users for supported resource types.
- RAM is available to you at `no additional charge`.

You can create resources centrally in a multi-account environment, and use RAM to share those resources across accounts in three simple steps: 
- Create a Resource Share
- Specify resources like [Subnet](../16_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/3_NetworkFoundationsVPC/Subnets.md), [Transit Gateway](../16_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/3_NetworkFoundationsVPC/ConnectBetweenVPCs/TransitGateway.md) etc.
- Specify accounts
