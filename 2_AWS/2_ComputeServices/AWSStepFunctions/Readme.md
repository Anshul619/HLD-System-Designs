# AWS Step Functions
- [AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) is a serverless orchestration service that lets you integrate with [AWS Lambda](../AWSLambda/Readme.md) functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications.
- [AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) provides serverless orchestration for modern applications. 
- Orchestration centrally manages a workflow by breaking it into multiple steps, adding flow logic, and tracking the inputs and outputs between the steps.

|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pass state     | A pass state passes its input to its output, without performing work.                                                    |
| Task state     | A task state represents a single unit of work performed by a state machine. Example - AWS Lambda function, ECS task etc. |
| Choice state   | A choice state adds branching logic to a state machine.                                                                  |
| Wait state     | A wait state delays the state machine from continuing for a specified time.                                              |
| Succeed state  | A succeed state stops an activity successfully                                                                           |
| Fail state     | A fail state stops the activity of the state machine & marks it as a failure, unless it is caught by a catch block.      |
| Parallel state | The parallel state can be used to create parallel branches of activity in your state machine.                            |
| Map state      | The map state can be used to run a set of steps for each element of an input array.                                      |

## Handle Partial failure for a transaction in Microservices architecture
- In microservices architecture, step function can be helpful to handle partial failure for a business transaction like order placement,
- With distributed data stores, partial execution failures will happen and Step functions can be helpful to handle those.
