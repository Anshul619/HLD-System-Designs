# AWS lambda networking
- Lambda functions always operate from an AWS-owned VPC.
- By default, your function has full ability to make network requests to any public internet address â€” this includes access to any of the public AWS APIs.

# VPC-enabled
- Once your function is [VPC-enabled](../../16_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/3_NetworkFoundationsVPC/Readme.md), all network traffic from your function is subject to the routing rules of your [VPC/Subnet](../../16_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/3_NetworkFoundationsVPC/Readme.md).
- If your function needs to interact with a public resource, you will need a route through a [NAT gateway in a public subnet](../../16_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/3_NetworkFoundationsVPC/Readme.md).
