| Deletion Protection      | [To delete a CMK in AWS KMS, you schedule key deletion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html). <br/>- You can set the waiting period from a minimum of 7 days up to a maximum of 30 days. <br/>- The default waiting period is 30 days.<br/>- During the waiting period, the CMK status and key state is Pending deletion.<br/>- To recover the CMK, you can cancel key deletion before the waiting period ends.                                                     |
| Key Policy               | A [key policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) is a resource policy for an AWS KMS key.<br/>- Every KMS key must have exactly one key policy.<br/>- The statements in the key policy determine who has permission to use the KMS key and how they can use it.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Multi-Region keys        | [AWS KMS supports multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html), which are AWS KMS keys in different AWS Regions that can be used interchangeably â€“ as though you had the same key in multiple Regions.<br/>- Each set of related multi-region keys has the same key material and key ID, so you can encrypt data in one AWS region and decrypt it in a different AWS region without re-encrypting or making a cross-region call to AWS KMS. |
| Multi-Region keys for S3 | [Amazon S3](../../7_StorageServices/3_S3ObjectStorage/Readme.md) currently treats multi-region keys as though they were single-region keys, and does not use the multi-region features of the key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
