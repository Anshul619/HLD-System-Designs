# Amazon EBS Snapshots
- [Amazon EBS Snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html) create incremental point-in-time copies of your data.
- As a managed AWS service, your snapshots are stored in a managed [Amazon S3 bucket](../6_StorageServices/3_S3ObjectStorage/Readme.md).
