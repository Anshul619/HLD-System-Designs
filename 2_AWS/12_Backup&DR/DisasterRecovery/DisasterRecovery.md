| Recovery Strategy                                                                                                                                  | RTO/RPO                                | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [Pilot Light](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_disaster_recovery.html)              | RPO in minutes, RTO in tens of minutes | Provision a copy of your core workload infrastructure in the recovery Region. Replicate your data into the recovery Region and create backups of it there. Other elements such as application servers or serverless compute are not deployed, but can be created when needed with the necessary configuration and application code. |
| [Warm Standby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_disaster_recovery.html)             | RPO in seconds, RTO in minutes         | Maintain a scaled-down but fully functional version of your workload always running in the recovery Region. <br/>- Business-critical systems are fully duplicated and are always on, but with a scaled down fleet.                                                                                                                  |
| [Multi-site active/active](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_disaster_recovery.html) | RPO near zero, RTO potentially zero    | Your workload is deployed to, and actively serving traffic from, multiple AWS Regions. This strategy requires you to synchronize data across Regions.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Backup & Restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_disaster_recovery.html)         | RPO in hours, RTO in 24 hours or less  | Back up your data and applications into the recovery Region. Using automated or continuous backups will permit point in time recovery (PITR), which can lower RPO to as low as 5 minutes in some cases.                                                                                                                             |
