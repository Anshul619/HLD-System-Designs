| Data that is accessed together, should be stored together | Instead of distributing related data items across multiple tables, you should keep related items in your NoSQL system as close together as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Vertical partitioning                                     | Breaks items into multiple items using [partition key](3_Scalability-Techniques/PartitioningSharding/PartitionKey/Readme.md) & [sort key](3_Scalability-Techniques/PartitioningSharding/PartitionKey/SortKey.md).<br/>- [Read more](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/use-vertical-partitioning-to-scale-data-efficiently-in-amazon-dynamodb/) |
| Use sort order                                            | All items with the same partition key value are stored together, in sorted order by [sort key value](3_Scalability-Techniques/PartitioningSharding/PartitionKey/SortKey.md).                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Distribute Queries                                        | Design [partition keys](3_Scalability-Techniques/PartitioningSharding/PartitionKey/Readme.md) to distribute traffic evenly across partitions as much as possible, avoiding [hot spots](3_Scalability-Techniques/PartitioningSharding/PartitionKey/HotPartition.md).                                                                                |
| Use secondary indexes                                     | By creating specific [secondary indexes](https://github.com/Anshul619/AWS-Services/tree/main/1_Databases/AmazonDynamoDB/SecondaryIndexes.md), you can enable different queries than your main table can support, and that are still fast and relatively inexpensive.                                                                               |
