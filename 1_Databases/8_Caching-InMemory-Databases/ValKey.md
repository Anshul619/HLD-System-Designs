# ValKey
- [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) is an open source (BSD) high-performance key/value datastore that supports a variety of workloads such as caching, message queues, and can act as a primary database.
- It is a drop-in replacement for [Redis OSS](Redis/Readme.md).
- The project is backed by the Linux Foundation, ensuring it will remain open source forever.
- Valkey can run as either a standalone daemon or in a cluster, with options for replication and high availability. 
- Valkey natively supports a rich collection of datatypes, including strings, numbers, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and more. 
- You can operate on data structures in-place with an expressive collection of commands. 
- Valkey also supports native extensibility with built-in scripting support for Lua and supports module plugins to create new commands, data types, and more.
