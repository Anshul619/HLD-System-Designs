| :star: [Strings](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/strings/)         | **Strings** are Redis most basic data type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [JSON - RedisStack](https://redis.io/docs/stack/json/)              | **JSON** can be stored as values in Redis.<br/>- Another option is to stringify JSON and then store it as **string datatype** in Redis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :star: [Sorted sets](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/sorted-sets/) | Every member of a **Sorted Set** is associated with a score, that is used to keep the Sorted Set in order, from the smallest to the greatest score.<br/>- While members are unique, scores may be repeated.<br/>- Sample - [Create a Redis Leaderboard with Golang](https://www.vultr.com/docs/create-a-redis-leaderboard-with-golang/)                                                                                                                                     |
| [Hashes](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/hashes/)                  | **Redis Hashes** are maps between string fields and string values, so they are the perfect data type to represent objects (e.g. A User with a number of fields like name, surname, age, and so forth).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Sets](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/sets/)                      | **Redis Sets** are an unordered collection of Strings. <br/>- It is possible to add, remove, and test for existence of members in **O(1)** (constant time regardless of the number of elements contained inside the Set).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Lists](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/lists/)                    | **Redis Lists** are simply lists of strings, sorted by insertion order.<br/>- The main features of Redis Lists from the point of view of time complexity are the support for constant time (**O(1)**) insertion and deletion of elements near the head and tail, even with many millions of inserted items.<br/>- Accessing elements is very fast near the extremes of the list but is slow if you try accessing the middle of a very big list, as it is an O(N) operation. |
| [GeoSpatial Indexes](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/geospatial/)  | **Redis geospatial indexes** let you store coordinates and search for them. This data structure is useful for finding nearby points within a given radius or bounding box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [BitMaps](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/bitmaps/)                | **Redis bitfields** let you set, increment, and get integer values of arbitrary bit length.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Streams                                                             | [Redis stream](../../15_Streaming-Databases/RedisStreams.md) is a data structure that acts like an [append-only log](../../5_Database-Internals/AppendOnlyProperty.md) but also implements several operations to overcome some of the limits of a typical append-only log.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| TimeSeries - RedisStack                                             | [Redis TimeSeries](../../12_TimeSeries-Databases/RedisTimeSeries.md) ingest and query time series data with Redis (with start time and end-time).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
