| Description                          | To decrease delay in writes in fully-sync replication, we can have one of the follower replication as synchronous while others as asynchronous. | In case of asynchronous replication, leader sends the message, but does not wait for a response from the follower. | In case of synchronous replication, the leader waits until follower1 has confirmed that it received the write before reporting success to the user, and before making the write visible to other clients. |
