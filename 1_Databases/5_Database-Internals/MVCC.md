# MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control)
- [Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC)](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/What-is-MVCC-How-does-Multiversion-Concurrencty-Control-work) is a database optimization technique. 
- MVCC creates duplicate copies of records so that data can be safely read and updated at the same time.
- With MVCC, database reads and writes donâ€™t block each other, and that greatly enhances the user experience.
