| Title                                | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :star: Avoid Expensive Joins         | Everytime you do a join, you kill a CPU cycle. Hence minimise joins.<br/>- Badly written queries with bad joins, logic etc. that take a lot of CPU and memory.                                                        |
| :star: Indexing                      | [Index the columns](../5_Database-Internals/Indexing.md), to improve READ queries performance.                                                                                                                         |
| Minimize select columns              | Minimize select columns in the SQL Queries.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Profile Slow Query logs              | Observe [Slow Queries logs](https://severalnines.com/blog/how-identify-mysql-performance-issues-slow-queries/) and find out low performing queries.                                                                   |
| Connection Pooling                   | No connection pooling in place, which cause applications to make huge number of connections in an uncontrollable manner.                                                                                              |
| Prevent having JSON columns          | Selecting JSON columns degrades SQL query performance. [Read more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71086258/query-on-json-jsonb-column-super-slow-can-i-use-an-index).                                            |

| Understand query planner             | The [PostgreSQL query execution mechanism](https://pganalyze.com/docs/explain/basics-of-postgres-query-planning) is fairly intricate, but important to understand well in order to get the most out of your database. |
