# VPC Peering
- [A VPC peering connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html) is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. 
- Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
