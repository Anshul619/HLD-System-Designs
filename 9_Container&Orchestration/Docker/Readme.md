# Docker
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. (Package it once and leverage it across environments)
- Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. 
- With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

| [Docker Daemon](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)                         | General           | [Docker daemon (dockerd)](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker Objects such as images, containers, networks & volumes.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Docker Client (Optional)](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)              | General           | When you use commands such as docker run, [the client](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.                                                                                                    |

| [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)                             | Volume            | Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

# Docker Run vs Docker Compose
- `docker run` is entirely command line based, while [docker-compose](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Docker-run-vs-docker-compose-Whats-the-difference) reads configuration data from a YAML file.
- `docker run` can only start one container at a time, while [docker-compose](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Docker-run-vs-docker-compose-Whats-the-difference) will configure and run multiple.

# Docker Image Layers
- [Each layer](https://vsupalov.com/docker-image-layers/) is an image itself, just one without a human-assigned tag.
- Each instruction in a Dockerfile results in a layer. (Except for multi-stage builds, where usually only the layers in the final image are pushed, or when an image is squashed to a single layer).
- They have auto-generated IDs though.
- Each layer stores the changes compared to the image it’s based on.
- An image can consist of a single layer (that’s often the case when the squash command was used).
- Layers are used to avoid transferring redundant information and skip build steps which have not changed (according to the Docker cache).

# The underlying technology
- [Docker]() is written in the [Go programming language](https://github.com/Anshul619/Golang) and takes advantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality. 
- [Docker]() uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. 
- When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.
