# How can we define big data?

|              | Remarks                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Volume  | 100s of TB into PB-scale and higher                                          |
| Architecture | Parallel Processing often involved - Hadoop, Spark, data warehouse platforms |
| Necessity    | Processing of data sets too large for operational databases                  |
| Nominally    | Big data tech sometimes imposed on small data problems                       |
