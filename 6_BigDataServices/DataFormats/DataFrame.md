# What is a DataFrame?
- A [DataFrame](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/what-are-dataframes) is a data structure that organizes data into a 2-dimensional table of rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet. 
- DataFrames are one of the most common data structures used in modern data analytics because they are a flexible and intuitive way of storing and working with data.
- Every DataFrame contains a blueprint, known as a schema, that defines the name and data type of each column. Spark DataFrames can contain universal data types like StringType and IntegerType, as well as data types that are specific to Spark, such as StructType. Missing or incomplete values are stored as null values in the DataFrame.
- The concept of a DataFrame is common across many languages and frameworks. DataFrames are the main data type used in pandas, the popular Python data analysis library, and DataFrames are also used in R, Scala, and other languages.
