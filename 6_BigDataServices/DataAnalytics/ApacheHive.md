# Apache Hive
- [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) is a distributed, fault-tolerant data warehouse system that enables analytics at a massive scale. 
- Hive Metastore(HMS) provides a central repository of metadata that can easily be analyzed to make informed, data driven decisions, and therefore it is a critical component of many data lake architectures. 
- Hive is built on top of [Apache Hadoop](../ApacheHadoop/Readme.md) and supports storage on S3, adls, gs etc though [hdfs](../../11_FileStorageServicesHDFS/ApacheHDFS.md). 
- Hive allows users to read, write, and manage petabytes of data using SQL.
