# Container Orchestration Service
- [Container orchestration service](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/container-orchestration.html) is the container management service.
- They are also responsible for the allocation of resources/servers to tasks/services. 
- Every task/service needs to specify its required resources (e.g., 3 CPU cores, 2 GiB of RAM). 
- Using the list of requirements for all tasks/services, Orchestrator can bin-pack the tasks over the machines in an optimal way that [also accounts for failure domains](../7_PropertiesDistributedSystem/Reliability/FaultTolerance.md).

# Benefits 
- How many resources are still available on the different machines?
- When to schedule the next container?
- If the docker container is crashed and not running anymore? 
- If replicates need to be removed? How to remove? One by one?

If youâ€™re trying to manage your compute at a large scale, you must know the following:
- How to place your containers on your instances? 
- What happens if your container fails?
- What happens if your instance fails?
- How to monitor deployments of your containers?

This coordination is handled by a [container orchestration services]().
