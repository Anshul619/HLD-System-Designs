# Event Driven Architecture
- An [event-driven architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/event-driven-architecture/) uses events to trigger and communicate between loosely coupled services and is common in modern applications built with [microservices](../../5_MicroServices/Readme.md).
- [Message brokers]() like [Kafka](../Kafka/Readme.md), [Amazon SQS](../../2_AWS/4_MessageBrokerServices/AmazonSQS/Readme.md), [RabbitMQ](../RabbitMQ.md), can be used in the event-driven architecture.
