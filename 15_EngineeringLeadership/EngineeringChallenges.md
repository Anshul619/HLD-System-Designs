| High Cognitive Load   | Requirements and domain concepts are not consistently understood.                                                            |
| Complexity            | [Siloed](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/siloed) interpretations create complexity and inconsistency. |
| Lack of Skill Mastery | While employees are hired for generic skills, domain specific mastery is not enabled structurally.                           |
| Ad Hoc Changes        | Quite a few times developers struggle with ad hoc changes in definitions & requirements.                                     |
