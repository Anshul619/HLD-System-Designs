# ElasticSearch with GraphQL
- There are several libraries which expose the [full Elasticsearch API](../3_Databases/9_Search-Databases/ElasticSearch/Readme.md) as a GraphQL API.
- But like traditional [REST APIs](../3_Databases/9_Search-Databases/Features/RESTAPIs.md) with Elasticsearch Backends, we mostly donâ€™t want to expose all the possibilities which the **Elasticsearch Query Language** offers to the end users.
- At the end we have a GraphQL API running on two NodeJS nodes and two Elasticsearch nodes, serving up to **5000rpm in a 50ms**.
