# Hotstar - Scaling for Tsunami traffic (with own auto-scaler)

| Title                        | Remarks                                                                                                                    |

| Pre-scaling before the event | We use auto-scaling to ensure the right amount of servers always exist in a pool, but weâ€™re always scaled up for the peak. |
| No-dump clients              | Caching, exponential back-offs and panic protocols.                                                                        |

| Scaling Trigger | Some services can be scaled up based on CPU utilization, others can be scaled based on the number of messages in the queue.<br/>- However, the most common scaling approach is to scale up based on the number of requests being processed by the service (**Traffic based scaling**). |
| Scale-up Time   | This is the time from when the scaling decision is made to the time when new infra starts serving traffic.<br/>- This includes, time to add more infrastructure, scheduling and spinning up new instances and the application start time (along with any pre-warming time required).   |
| Scaling Buffers | This is the maximum traffic surge expected by the service during the **Scale-up Time**.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
