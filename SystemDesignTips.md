| **Requirements Gathering**       | Understand functional & non-functional requirements   | Identify throughput, latency, availability, durability, compliance needs, and access patterns early.                               |
|                                  | Define use cases and constraints                      | Include scale, cost, technology constraints, and regulatory requirements.                                                          |
|                                  | Assume requirements will change                       | Design for flexibility — parameterize configs, use modular components.                                                             |
|                                  | Accept tradeoffs                                      | There’s no perfect system — balance cost, complexity, performance, and maintainability.                                            |
| **Performance Goals**            | Target high throughput with acceptable latency        | [Maximal throughput](4_Scalability/Throughput.md) and [acceptable latency](4_Scalability/Latency.md) — set quantifiable SLAs/SLOs. |

|                                  | Consider microservices with event-driven architecture | Use message queues or Kafka for decoupling, scalability, and flexibility.                                                          |
