| Understand the system requirements carefully                                                        | Requirements Gathering | Identify access patterns, key components in the required architecture like `Data Chunking`, `Data Aggregation` etc.                                                                                   |
| Design system with High Throughput & Acceptable Latency                                             | Requirements Gathering | While designing the solution, generally we should aim for `MAXIMAL throughput` with `ACCEPTABLE latency`.                                                                                             |
| [Design Microservice Based architecture](4_MicroServicesSOA/Readme.md)                              | Microservices          | Design system using [Event Driven Architecture](4_MicroServicesSOA/EventDrivenArchitecture.md).                                                                                                       |
| [API - Performance Considerations](8_APITechOptions/APIPerformanceTuning.md)                        | Microservices          |                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Read-heavy microservice                                                                             | Database               | If it's a READ heavy microservice, the best decision would be to use [Redis](3_DatabaseServices/In-Memory-DB/Redis) or `multi-read SQL instances` (in case dynamic input params like time).           |
| Write-heavy microservice                                                                            | Database               | If it's a WRITE heavy microservice (`high throughput`), the best decision would be to write to [Kafka](5_MessageBrokers/Kafka/Readme.md) (as message broker) first and then use NoSQL-DB for storage. |

| [Sharding of the database](3_DatabaseServices/Glossaries/PartitioningSharding)                      | Database               | To scale the data store horizontally (i.e. improve `write throughput`), [shard the databases]() (through consistent hashing technique etc.).                                                          |
| [Partition Key of database](3_DatabaseServices/Glossaries/PartitioningSharding/PartitionKeyTips.md) | Database               | Decide partition key carefully (to prevent hot partition problem).                                                                                                                                    |
