| Understand the system requirements carefully            | Requirements Gathering | Identify access patterns, key components in the required architecture like **Data Chunking**, **Data Aggregation** etc.                                                                                                  |
| Design system with High Throughput & Acceptable Latency | Requirements Gathering | While designing the solution, generally we should aim for [maximal throughput](7_Scalability/Throughput.md) with [acceptable latency](7_Scalability/Latency.md). |
| Design Microservice based architecture                  | Microservices          | Design system using [Event Driven Architecture](4_MessageBrokersEDA/EventDrivenArchitecture/Readme.md).                                                                                                                  |
| API Performance Considerations                          | Microservices          | [Read more](7_Scalability/APIPerformanceTuning.md)                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Write-heavy microservice like ClickStream               | Microservices          | If it's a write heavy microservice, the best decision would be to write to [Kafka](4_MessageBrokersEDA/Kafka/Readme.md) first (data ingestion) and then use [NoSQL-DB](3_DatabaseServices/Readme.md) for storage.        |
| Choose database based on query patterns                 | Database               | [Read more](3_DatabaseServices/Readme.md)                                                                                                                                                                                |
