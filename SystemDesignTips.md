| Understand the system requirements carefully                               | Requirements Gathering | Identify access patterns, key components in the required architecture like `Data Chunking`, `Data Aggregation` etc.                                                                                                                        |
| Design system with High Throughput & Acceptable Latency                    | Requirements Gathering | While designing the solution, generally we should aim for `MAXIMAL throughput` with `ACCEPTABLE latency`.                                                                                                                                  |
| [Design Microservice based architecture](5_MicroServicesSOA/Readme.md)     | Microservices          | Design system using [Event Driven Architecture](4_MessageBrokersEDA/EventDrivenArchitecture/Readme.md).                                                                                                                                    |
| [API - Performance Considerations](8_APIProtocols/APIPerformanceTuning.md) | Microservices          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Write-heavy microservice like ClickStream                                  | Microservices          | If it's a write heavy microservice (with `high throughput`), the best decision would be to write to [Kafka](4_MessageBrokersEDA/Kafka/Readme.md) first (data ingestion) and then use [NoSQL-DB](3_DatabaseServices/Readme.md) for storage. |
