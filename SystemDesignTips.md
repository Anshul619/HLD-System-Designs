| Understand the functional & non-functional requirements carefully, before designing   | Requirements Gathering    | Identify access patterns, key components in the required architecture like **Data Chunking**, **Data Aggregation**.                                                                                                       |
| Clearly define the use cases and constraints of the system.                           | Requirements Gathering    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Assume requirements will change and design the system to be flexible.                 | Requirements Gathering    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Design system with High Throughput & Acceptable Latency                               | Requirements Gathering    | While designing the solution, generally we should aim for [maximal throughput](4_Scalability/Throughput.md) with [acceptable latency](4_Scalability/Latency.md).                                                          |
