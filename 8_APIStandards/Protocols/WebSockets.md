| WebSockets        | It provides a persistent connection between a client and a server that both parties can use to start sending data at any time. <br/>- The client establishes a WebSocket connection through a process known as the WebSocket handshake. <br/>- If the process succeeds, then the server and client can exchange data in both directions at any time                                        |
| Ajax Polling      | The basic idea is that the client repeatedly polls (or requests) a server for data. The client makes a request and waits for the server to respond with data. If no data is available, an empty response is returned.<br/>- The problem with Polling is that the client has to keep asking the server for any new data. As a result, a lot of responses are empty, creating HTTP overhead. |
| HTTP Long-Polling | With Long-Polling, the client requests information from the server exactly as in normal polling, but with the expectation that the server may not respond immediately. That’s why this technique is sometimes referred to as a “Hanging GET”.                                                                                                                                              |
