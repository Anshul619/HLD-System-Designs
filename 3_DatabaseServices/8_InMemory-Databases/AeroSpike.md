# Introduction
- [Aerospike](https://aerospike.com/) is an open-source, modern database built from the ground up to push the limits of flash storage, processors and networks. 
- It was designed to operate with [predictable low latency at high throughput](../../7_PropertiesDistributedSystem/Scalability/Latency.md) with uncompromising reliability, both [high availability](../../7_PropertiesDistributedSystem/Reliability/HighAvailability.md) and [ACID guarantees](../1_ACIDTransactions/Readme.md).

# Why AeroSpike?
- In-memory and NoSQL databases are a database combination that is being employed by a growing number of applications. 
- Aerospike features a Hybrid Memory Architecture, which makes it unique. 
- When using a persistent SSD, the index is kept in memory while the data is stored on the disc and then retrieved from the drive, as opposed to when using a non-persistent SSD.
