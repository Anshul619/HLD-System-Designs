# Connect API
- [Connect API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connectapi) allows implementing connectors that continually pull from some source data system into Kafka or push from Kafka into some sink data system.
- Many users of [Connect](../../../6_BigDataServices/DataConnectors/KafkaConnect.md) won't need to use this API directly, though, they can use pre-built connectors without needing to write any code.
