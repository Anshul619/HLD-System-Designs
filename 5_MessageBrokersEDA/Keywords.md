| [Event](EventDrivenArchitecture/Readme.md)                                      | All                 | A record (mostly in JSON) is more commonly known as an **event**, <br/>- but it is essentially the same thing: **a small, self- contained, immutable object** containing the details of something that happened at some point in time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Producer (also known as a publisher or sender)                                  | All                 | An event is generated once by a producer. i.e. Producer writes event into the topics (1 or more).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Consumers (subscribers or recipients)                                           | All                 | Event processed by consumer. <br/>- A consumer can subscribe (listen) to the topics (1 or more) and read data from those in the message broker.<br/>- Each consumer in a consumer group will be responsible for reading a subset of the partitions of each subject to which they have subscribed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| [Partitioning/Sharding](../3_DatabaseServices/PartitioningSharding/Readme.md)   | Log-based brokers   | Logs can be partitioned to increase the throughput. <br/>- Different partitions can then be hosted on different brokers/machines, making each partition a separate log that can be read and written independently from other partitions.<br/>- A topic can then be defined as a group of partitions that all carry messages of the same type.<br/>- Within each partition, the broker assigns a monotonically increasing sequence num‐ ber, or offset, to every message.                                                                                                                |
| [Partition Key](../3_DatabaseServices/PartitioningSharding/PartitionKeyTips.md) | Log-based brokers   | Partitioning is done using `key` in the record.<br/>- If we want to sequence records execution, as per the records input time, we should push those in the same partition (hence same key should be used for the records).<br/>- Default message routing is `hash-mod`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Consumer Offset                                                                 | Log-based brokers   | Consuming a partition sequentially makes it easy to tell which messages have been processed.<br/>- All messages with an offset less than a consumer’s current offset have already been processed<br/>- And all messages with a greater offset have not yet been seen. <br/>- Thus, the broker does not need to track acknowledgments for every single message— it only needs to periodically record the consumer offsets. <br/>- The reduced bookkeeping overhead and the opportunities for batching and pipelining in this approach help increase the throughput of log-based systems. |
