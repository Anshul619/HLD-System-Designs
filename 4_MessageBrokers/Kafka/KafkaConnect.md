# Kafka Connect
- [Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect) is a tool for scalably and reliably streaming data between Apache Kafka and other systems.
- Kafka Connect can ingest entire databases or collect metrics from all your application servers into Kafka topics, making the data available for stream processing with low latency.
- This opens up possibilities for constructing and managing the operations of producers and consumers, as well as establishing reusable links between these solutions. 
- A connector, for example, may capture [all database updates](../../3_DatabaseServices/Glossaries/ChangeDataCapture.md) and ensure that they are made available in a Kafka topic.
