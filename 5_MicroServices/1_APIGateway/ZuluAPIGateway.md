# Zulu API Gateway
- [Zulu](https://stackabuse.com/spring-cloud-routing-with-zuul-and-gateway/) is an API gateway, for routing microservices properly. 
- [Netflix](https://github.com/Anshul619/Real-World-Tech-Stacks/tree/main/Netflix/Readme.md) created [Zuul server]() and later open-sourced it.
- Spring provided a nice wrapper around it for easily incorporating it to the Spring stack.
