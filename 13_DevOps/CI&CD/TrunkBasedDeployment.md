# Trunk-based development
- [Trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) is a version control management practice where developers merge small, frequent updates to a core “trunk” or main branch.
- Since it streamlines merging and integration phases, it helps achieve CI/CD and increases software delivery and organizational performance.
