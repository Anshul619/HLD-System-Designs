|                  | Java                                                                      | NodeJS                                                                                            |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scalability      | Complex, web-based, highly concurrent.                                    | Speedy and scalable server-side                                                                   |
| Project Sizes    | Best suited for complex, larger, web-based projects that need concurrency | Best suited for Smaller-sized projects                                                            |
| Web Applications | Highly concurrent applications, messaging, complex web applications.      | Running scalable and faster applications, real-time collaborative applications (e.g. Google Docs) |
