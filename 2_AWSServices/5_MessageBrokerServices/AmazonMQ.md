# Amazon MQ
- [Amazon MQ](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq) is a managed message broker service for [Apache ActiveMQ](../../5_MessageBrokers/ActiveMQ.md) and [RabbitMQ](../../5_MessageBrokers/RabbitMQ.md) that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers on AWS.
- Amazon MQ reduces your operational responsibilities by managing the provisioning, setup, and maintenance of message brokers for you.
- Because Amazon MQ connects to your current applications with industry-standard APIs and protocols, `you can easily migrate to AWS without having to rewrite code`.
