| Object storage limits              | Thereâ€™s no limit to the number of objects you can store in a bucket. <br/>- You can store all of your objects in a single bucket, or organize them across several buckets. <br/>- However, you can't create a bucket from within another bucket, also known as nesting buckets. |
| Bucket creation limits             | By default, you can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. <br/>- If you need additional buckets, you can increase your account bucket limit to a maximum of 1,000 buckets by submitting a service limit increase.                                              |
