# Amazon S3 Storage Classes
- Amazon S3 offers a range of [storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/) that you can choose from based on the data access, resiliency, and cost requirements of your workloads. 
- S3 storage classes are purpose-built to provide the lowest cost storage for different access patterns. 
- S3 storage classes are ideal for virtually any use case, including those with demanding performance needs, data residency requirements, unknown or changing access patterns, or archival storage.

# Provisioned Capacity
- [Provisioned capacity units](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/glacier-provisioned-capacity) allow you to pay a fixed, up-front, monthly fee to ensure the availability of retrieval capacity.
- Provisioned capacity helps ensure that your retrieval capacity for expedited retrievals is available when you need it.
- Each unit of capacity allows at least three expedited retrievals to be performed every five minutes and provides up to 150 MB/s of retrieval throughput.

# Amazon S3 Glacier
- The [Amazon S3 Glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/) storage classes are purpose-built for data archiving, providing you with the highest performance, most retrieval flexibility, and the lowest cost archive storage in the cloud.
