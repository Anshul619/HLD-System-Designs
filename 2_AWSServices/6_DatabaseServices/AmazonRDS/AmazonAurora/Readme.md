# Amazon RDS Aurora
- [Amazon RDS Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) is designed for [unparalleled high performance and availability at global scale](../../../../3_SystemGlossaries/Scalability/LatencyThroughput.md) with full MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database).
- Aurora is [AWS Cloud Optimized (proprietary technology](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) from AWS, not open-source and claims [5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x performance improvement over Postgres on RDS](../../../../3_SystemGlossaries/Scalability/LatencyThroughput.md).
- [High throughput up to 200K writes/second](../../../../3_SystemGlossaries/Scalability/LatencyThroughput.md), with negligible performance impact.
