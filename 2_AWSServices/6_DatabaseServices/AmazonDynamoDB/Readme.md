# Amazon DynamoDB
- [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a fully managed [NoSQL](../../../3_DatabaseServices/NoSQL-Databases/Readme.md) database service.
- It is a [key-value & document DB](../../../3_DatabaseServices/NoSQL-Databases/Readme.md) service, for fast lookup using primary key.
- Every record in a DynamoDB database can be considered as a map of attributes and values with a primary key to retrieve the record.
- All data items are stored on [Solid State Drives (SSDs)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/SSD-solid-state-drive), and are replicated across [3 Availability Zones](../../AWS-Global-Architecture-Region-AZ.md) for [high availability](../../../7_PropertiesDistributedSystem/Reliability/HighAvailability.md) and [durability](../../../3_DatabaseServices/Glossaries/ACIDTransactions/Durability.md). 
- With DynamoDB, you can offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available distributed database cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.

# History of DynamoDB
> [How Amazon’s DynamoDB helped reinvent databases?](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2932313/how-amazon-s-dynamodb-helped-reinvent-databases.html)
> Amazon DynamoDB is built on the principles of [Dynamo](../../../3_DatabaseServices/Glossaries/DataStructuresDB/DynamoStyleDatabases.md) and is a hosted service within the AWS infrastructure.
> However, while [Dynamo](../../../3_DatabaseServices/Glossaries/DataStructuresDB/DynamoStyleDatabases.md) is based on [leaderless replication](../../../3_DatabaseServices/Glossaries/Consistency&Replication/Replication.md), DynamoDB uses [single-leader replication](../../../3_DatabaseServices/Glossaries/Consistency&Replication/Replication.md).

# Data types supported in DynamoDB

|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scalar      | These types represent a single value, and include number, string, binary, Boolean, and null.        |
| Document    | These types represent a complex structure possessing nested attributes, and include lists and maps. |

# :thumbsdown: What are disadvantages of DynamoDB?
- Deployable only on AWS and cannot be installed on individual desktops/servers
- No server side scripts
- General disadvantages of NoSQL
  - Querying data is extremely limited
  - Table Joins are impossible
  - No triggers
  - No foreign key concept to refer to other table items
