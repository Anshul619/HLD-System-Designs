# Amazon DynamoDB
- [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a fully managed [key-value & document DB](../../../3_DatabaseServices/10_Document-Databases/) service, for fast lookup using primary key.
- Every record in a DynamoDB database can be considered as a map of attributes and values with a [primary key](Partioning.md) to retrieve the record.
- All data items are stored on [Solid State Drives (SSDs)](../../../11_FileStorageServicesHDFS/StorageOptions.md), and are replicated across [3 Availability Zones](../../AWS-Global-Architecture-Region-AZ.md) for [high availability](../../../7_PropertiesDistributedSystem/Reliability/HighAvailability.md) and [durability](../../../3_DatabaseServices/1_ACIDTransactions/Durability.md). 
- With DynamoDB, you can offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available distributed database cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.

| Tables                                              | DynamoDB stores data in tables. A table is a collection of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Items                                               | Each table contains zero or more items. <br/>- An item is a group of attributes that is uniquely identifiable among all the other items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Attributes                                          | Each item is composed of one or more attributes. <br/>- An attribute is a fundamental data element, something that does not need to be broken down any further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Partitions & primary key                            | When you create a table, in addition to the table name, you must specify the [primary key](Partioning.md) of the table. <br/>- The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table so that no two items can have the same key.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Secondary Indexes                                   | Using a [secondary index](SecondaryIndexes.md), you can query the data in the table using an alternate key and also against the primary key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Quotas & Limits                                     | [Read more](Quotas&Limits.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Read Consistency Models                             | [Eventual Consistency Model & Strong Consistency Model](ReadConsistency.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| DynamoDB Streams                                    | [DynamoDB Streams](Streams.md) is an optional feature that captures data modification events in DynamoDB tables. <br/>- The data about these events appear in the stream in near real time, and in the order that the events occurred.                                                                                                                                                             |
| ACID transactions (with limitations)                | DynamoDB supports [ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) transactions](Transactions.md) to enable you to build business-critical applications at scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Capacity Modes - OnDemand, Provisioned, Autoscaling | DynamoDB supports [OnDemand, Provisioned, Autoscaling capacity modes](CapacityModes/Readme.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)                          | You can use [Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)](DAX.md), which is an [in-memory store]() for DynamoDB, without the need to modify application logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Fault tolerant & Highly Available                   | Data replicated across [3 Availability Zones](../../AWS-Global-Architecture-Region-AZ.md).<br/>- Writes are acknowledged only when its done on 2 copies (AZs) of the partition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Global tables                                       | Using [global tables](GlobalTables.md), build global applications with fast access to local data by easily replicating tables across multiple AWS Regions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Time to Live (TTL)                                  | Based on the attribute, the record can be configured [TTL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/TTL.html) to expire in DynamoDB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Security - IAM                                      | DynamoDB fully integrates with [AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM)](../../2a_IdentityServices/AWSIAM/Readme.md) for robust security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Encryption at rest                                  | By default, all tables are encrypted under an [AWS owned customer master key (CMK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/services-dynamodb.html) in the DynamoDB service account.<br/>- However, you cannot view, use, track, or audit them.                                                                                                                                      |
| Point-in-time recovery (PITR)                       | Amazon DynamoDB enables you to back up your table data continuously by using [point-in-time recovery (PITR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/PointInTimeRecovery_Howitworks.html). <br/>- When you enable PITR, DynamoDB backs up your table data automatically with per-second granularity so that you can restore to any given second in the preceding 35 days. |

# History of DynamoDB
> [How Amazon’s DynamoDB helped reinvent databases?](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2932313/how-amazon-s-dynamodb-helped-reinvent-databases.html)
> Amazon DynamoDB is built on the principles of [Dynamo](../../../3_DatabaseServices/5_DatabaseInternals/DynamoStyleDatabases.md) and is a hosted service within the AWS infrastructure.
> However, while [Dynamo](../../../3_DatabaseServices/5_DatabaseInternals/DynamoStyleDatabases.md) is based on [leaderless replication](../../../3_DatabaseServices/4_Consistency&Replication/Replication.md), DynamoDB uses [single-leader replication](../../../3_DatabaseServices/4_Consistency&Replication/Replication.md).

# Data types supported in DynamoDB

| Data Type   | Description                                                                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scalar      | These types represent a single value, and include number, string, binary, Boolean, and null.        |
| Document    | These types represent a complex structure possessing nested attributes, and include lists and maps. |
| Set         | These types represent multiple scalars, and include string sets, number sets, and binary sets.      |

# :thumbsdown: What are disadvantages of DynamoDB?
- Deployable only on AWS and cannot be installed on individual desktops/servers
- No server side scripts
- General disadvantages of NoSQL
  - Querying data is extremely limited
  - Table Joins are impossible
  - No triggers
  - No foreign key concept to refer to other table items
