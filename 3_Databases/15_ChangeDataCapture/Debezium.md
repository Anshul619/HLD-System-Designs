# Debezium
- [Debezium](https://debezium.io/) is an open source distributed platform for change data capture. 
- Start it up, point it at your databases, and your apps can start responding to all of the inserts, updates, and deletes that other apps commit to your databases. 
- Debezium is durable and fast, so your apps can respond quickly and never miss an event, even when things go wrong.
