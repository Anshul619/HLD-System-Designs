| [Caching](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/caching/)                                    | All                | One of the advantage of cache is to remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up the reads.                                                                                                    |
| [Session Storage](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/session-management/)                 | All                | In order to address scalability and to provide a shared data storage for sessions that can be accessible from any individual web server, you can abstract the HTTP sessions from the web servers themselves. |
| [Distributed Locks](https://redis.io/docs/manual/patterns/distributed-locks/)                | Strings            | We can use a Redis string to acquire locks among distributed services.<br/>- Example - [Twitter Hit Counter](../../../0_HLDUseCasesProblems/HitCounterDesignTwitter/Readme.md)                               |

| [Rank/Leaderboard](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/leaderboards/)                      | SortedSet          | We can use SortedSet to sort the articles.<br/>- Example - Best sellers, ranking etc.                                                                                                                        |
| [GeoSpatial](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/geospatial/)                                   | GeoSpatial Indexes | Redis geospatial indexes let you store coordinates and search for them. <br/>- This data structure is useful for finding nearby points within a given radius or bounding box.                                |
| [Message Broker - Queue with PubSub model](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/messaging/) | Lists              | We can use List for a message queue (with [PubSub](https://redis.io/docs/interact/pubsub/) modal).                                                                                                           |

# Key Features of Redis

| Supported features                                           | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Speed - 100K queries per second                              | Since Redis uses **in-memory** for storage, it is very fast. Generally, [Redis is 5 times faster than database](../../../7c_SystemEstimations&Benchmarking/LatencyNumbers.md). <br/>- Mostly **O(1) behavior**, to get data from redis.                                     |
| Transaction (atomicity)                                      | Using [Redis Transaction lock](https://redis.io/docs/reference/patterns/distributed-locks/), we can achieve [atomicity](../../1_ACIDTransactions/Atomicity.md) on the Redis operations (i.e. set/increase the key, add/remove elements from set, increase counter etc.). |
| Multiple data types                                          | [Multiple data types](https://redis.io/docs/manual/data-types/) are supported in Redis.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| [Sharding (using Redis Cluster)](RedisCluster.md)            | This helps in write scalability of redis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Data Persistence                                             | It's generally suggested to turn off persistence on the master node, so that you get consistent low latency response time.<br/>- No forking to disk will be done.<br/>- No wasted I/O.                                                                                   |

| :star: [Strings](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/strings/)         | **Strings** are Redis most basic data type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [JSON - RedisStack](https://redis.io/docs/stack/json/)              | **JSON** can be stored as values in Redis.<br/>- Another option is to stringify JSON and then store it as **string datatype** in Redis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :star: [Sorted sets](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/sorted-sets/) | Every member of a **Sorted Set** is associated with a score, that is used to keep the Sorted Set in order, from the smallest to the greatest score.<br/>- While members are unique, scores may be repeated.<br/>- Sample - [Create a Redis Leaderboard with Golang](https://www.vultr.com/docs/create-a-redis-leaderboard-with-golang/)                                                                                                                                     |
 | [Hashes](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/hashes/)                  | **Redis Hashes** are maps between string fields and string values, so they are the perfect data type to represent objects (e.g. A User with a number of fields like name, surname, age, and so forth).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Sets](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/sets/)                      | **Redis Sets** are an unordered collection of Strings. <br/>- It is possible to add, remove, and test for existence of members in **O(1)** (constant time regardless of the number of elements contained inside the Set).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Lists](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/lists/)                    | **Redis Lists** are simply lists of strings, sorted by insertion order.<br/>- The main features of Redis Lists from the point of view of time complexity are the support for constant time (**O(1)**) insertion and deletion of elements near the head and tail, even with many millions of inserted items.<br/>- Accessing elements is very fast near the extremes of the list but is slow if you try accessing the middle of a very big list, as it is an O(N) operation. |
| [GeoSpatial Indexes](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/geospatial/)  | **Redis geospatial indexes** let you store coordinates and search for them. This data structure is useful for finding nearby points within a given radius or bounding box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [BitMaps](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/bitmaps/)                | **Redis bitfields** let you set, increment, and get integer values of arbitrary bit length.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
