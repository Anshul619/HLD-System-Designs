# Vector Databases
- [Vector databases](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/vector-databases/) provide the ability to store and retrieve vectors as high-dimensional points. 
- They add additional capabilities for efficient and fast lookup of nearest-neighbors in the N-dimensional space. 
- They are typically powered by k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) indexes and built with algorithms like the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) and Inverted File Index (IVF) algorithms. 
- Vector databases provide additional capabilities like data management, fault tolerance, authentication and access control, and a query engine.
