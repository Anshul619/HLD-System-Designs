| [DRY Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)                                                                                         | The DRY (`don't repeat yourself`) principle is a best practice in software development that recommends software engineers to do something once, and only once.<br/>- The goal of the DRY principle is to lower technical debt by eliminating redundancies in process and logic whenever possible.<br/>- Abstraction is the process of removing characteristics until only the most essential characteristics remain. |
| [Design By Contract](https://www.leadingagile.com/2018/05/design-by-contract-part-one/)                                                                        | [Design by Contract (DbC)](https://www.leadingagile.com/2018/05/design-by-contract-part-one/) is an approach to software design that focuses on specifying contracts that define the interactions among components.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Orthogonality (programming)](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/orthogonality-cs-programming-languages-software-databases)                                           | In computer programming, orthogonality means that operations change just one thing without affecting others.<br/>- Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways to build the control and data structures of the language.                                                                                  |
| [Crash early and crash often for more reliable software](https://medium.com/@mattklein123/crash-early-and-crash-often-for-more-reliable-software-597738dd21c5) | Limit error handling to only errors that can actually happen during normal control flow. Crash otherwise.<br/>- Liberally use assertions to document invariant state and crash if violated.<br/>- Use single owner data semantics if at all possible to limit code complexity, and if doing this using C/C++, let the program crash if an ownership invariant is violated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
