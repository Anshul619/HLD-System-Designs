# What is ELK stack? How Elasticsearch connect with it?
- `Elasticsearch` is a `NoSQL database tool`, which is used to store the unstructured data.
- `Logstash` is a `log pipeline tool` to perform transformation on data.
    - It takes input from different sources and performs various transformations on it.
    - At last, it exports the data into various targets.
- `Kibana` is a `data visualization tool`, which provides an interactive UI (User Interface) to the users for data visualization.

# Notes
- ELK can be deployed on AWS using `Amazon OpenSearch` service.
