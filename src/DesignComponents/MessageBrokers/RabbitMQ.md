Basis                                 | Kafka                                                                              | RabbitMQ                                                                                                                                                           |
---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
Performance | Up to 1 million ( 1000K ) messages per second                                      | Up to 10K messages per second ( ie. around 100 nodes are needed to match with 1 kafka broker )                                                                     |                                                                                             |
Message Transfer Model | `Pull Based`                                                                         | `Push Based`                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                             |
Use Cases | Massive `data/high throughput cases` ( like analytics )                              | Simple `low-latency use cases` when message guarantee is needed or some consistent behaviour is needed for every message ( like order workflow, failed orders etc. ) |                                                                                             |
Event storage structure | `Logs`                                                                             | `Queue`                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                             |
Data Type | Operational                                                                        | Transactional                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                             |
Broker/Publisher Type | Dump                                                                               | `Smart` ( Consistent transmission of messages to consumers at about the same speed as the broker monitors the consumer's status)                                   |                                                                                             |
Consumer Type | `Smart` ( Consumers maintain their own state i.e. "dump" brokers )                   | Dumb                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                             |
Ordering Of Messages                  | Supported ( using `partition key` )                                                  | Not-Supported                                                                                                                                                      |
Lifetime Of Messages                  | As per retension policy, messages are retained in Kafka. And `these can be replayed`. | Once message is consumed and acknowledgement is sent, it would be removed from RabbitMQ message queue.                                                             |
Prioritizing Messages for consumption | Not-Supported.                                                                     | Supported                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                             |
Payload Size | `Default 1MB limit`                                                                  | No constraints                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                             |
