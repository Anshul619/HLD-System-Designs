## [AWS ECS - Containers as a Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) 
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable and fast container management service. 
- You can use it to run, stop, and manage containers on a cluster. 
- With Amazon ECS, your containers are defined in a task definition that you use to run an individual task or task within a service.

## [AWS CloudFormation - Infrastructure as a CODE](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
- AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. 
- `You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.` 
- You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what - CloudFormation handles that.
