- Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for [Apache ActiveMQ](../MessageBrokers/ActiveMQ.md) and [RabbitMQ](../MessageBrokers/RabbitMQ.md) that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers on AWS.
- Amazon MQ reduces your operational responsibilities by managing the provisioning, setup, and maintenance of message brokers for you.
- Because Amazon MQ connects to your current applications with industry-standard APIs and protocols, `you can easily migrate to AWS without having to rewrite code`.
