[AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)
- Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
- Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. 
- With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. 
- All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that Lambda supports.
