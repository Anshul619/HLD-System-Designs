# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Unquestionably, security has a lot to do with access and what gets accessed. 
- This service offers an effective fortification of sensitive data and AWS resources. 
- It can also be used in conjunction with your organization’s 2FA and MFA. 
- It’s just an additional layer of security that never hurts.
