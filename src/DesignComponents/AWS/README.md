[Availability Zone](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)| An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. AZs give customers the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center. There are `25 geographic regions` available in AWS.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
[Auto-scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) | Auto-scaling is a function that allows you to provision and launch new instances whenever there is a demand. It allows you to automatically increase or decrease resource capacity in relation to the demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

# What is a maintenance window in Amazon RDS? Will your DB instance be available during maintenance events?
- RDS maintenance window lets you decide when DB instance modifications, database engine version upgrades, and software patching have to occur. 
- The automatic scheduling is done only for patches that are related to security and durability. 
- By default, there is a 30-minute value assigned as the maintenance window and the DB instance will still be available during these events though you might observe a minimal effect on performance.

# [Amazon EC2 AutoScaling](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/ec2-auto-scaling-spot-instances/)
- `Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling` enables you to automatically launch or terminate Amazon EC2 instances based on user-defined policies, health status checks, and schedules. 
- You can use a `CloudWatch alarm with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling` to scale your EC2 instances based on demand. For more information, see Dynamic Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
