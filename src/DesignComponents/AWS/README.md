What is IAM? | AWS IAM allows an administrator to provide multiple users and groups with granular access. Various user groups and users may require varying levels of access to the various resources that have been developed. We may assign roles to users and create roles with defined access levels using IAM. It further gives us Federated Access, which allows us to grant applications and users access to resources without having to create IAM Roles.                                                                                                                           |

# What Is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Why Is It Used?
- A VPC is the best way of connecting to your cloud resources from your own data center. Once you connect your datacenter to the VPC in which your instances are present, each instance is assigned a private IP address that can be accessed from your data center. That way, you can access your public cloud resources as if they were on your own private network.

# Name and explain some security products and features available in VPC?
- `Security groups` - This acts as a firewall for the EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
- `Network access control lists` - It acts as a firewall for the subnets, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
- `Flow logs` - These capture the inbound and outbound traffic from the network interfaces in your VPC.

# How do you monitor Amazon VPC?
- `CloudWatch` 
- `CloudWatch logs`
- `VPC Flow Logs`

# How does Amazon Route 53 provide high availability and low latency?

## Globally Distributed Servers
- Amazon is a global service and consequently has DNS services globally. 
- Any customer creating a query from any part of the world gets to reach a `DNS server local` to them that provides low latency. 

## Dependency 
- `Route 53` provides a high level of dependability required by critical applications.

## Optimal Locations 
- `Route 53` uses a `global anycast network` to answer queries from the optimal position automatically.

# What is a maintenance window in Amazon RDS? Will your DB instance be available during maintenance events?
- RDS maintenance window lets you decide when DB instance modifications, database engine version upgrades, and software patching have to occur. 
- The automatic scheduling is done only for patches that are related to security and durability. 
- By default, there is a 30-minute value assigned as the maintenance window and the DB instance will still be available during these events though you might observe a minimal effect on performance.

# [Amazon EC2 AutoScaling](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/ec2-auto-scaling-spot-instances/)
- `Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling` enables you to automatically launch or terminate Amazon EC2 instances based on user-defined policies, health status checks, and schedules. 
- You can use a `CloudWatch alarm with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling` to scale your EC2 instances based on demand. For more information, see Dynamic Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

# Amazon OpsWorks
- With `AWS OpsWorks`, you can automate how nodes are configured, deployed, and managed, whether they are Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises devices.
