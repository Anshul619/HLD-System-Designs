- S3 is an object store, meaning it is a `higher layer data storage system`, essentially `it is a database "blob" storage`, storing data in an underlying `simple database as an object`.
- It's designed for `WRITE once READ many access`, perfect for `media data like image, video, documents` particularly as it is distributed and offers a very high level of redundancy.
