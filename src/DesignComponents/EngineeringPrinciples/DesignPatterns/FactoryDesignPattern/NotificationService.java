 * 1. Define a factory method inside an interface.
 * 2. Let the subclass implements the above factory method and decide which object to create.
 * 3. In Java constructors are not polymorphic, but by allowing subclass to create an object, we are adding polymorphic behavior to the instantiation.
 * 4. In short, we are trying to achieve Pseudo polymorphism by letting the subclass decide what to create, and so this Factory method is also called as.
 *
 * Now letâ€™s use factory class to create and get an object of concrete class by passing some information.
