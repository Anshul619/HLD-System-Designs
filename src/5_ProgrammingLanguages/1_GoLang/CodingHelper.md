# Basic Guidelines
- `In Go's philosophy, it is better to avoid unnecessary branches and indentation of code. It is also considered better to return as early as possible.`
- Type is defined at the end of declaration.
- Return variables ( multiple variables ) would be defined at the end.
- Multiple variables can be defined by `,`.
- Initialisation can be skipped with `:=`. 
  - Hence, practice to use `:=` mostly, instead of `var =`
  - Nil canâ€™t be initialised to the variable without explicit type.
- Trailing comma is not needed while initializing struct.
- Semicolon is not needed at the end.
- Brackets are not needed in `for or if` constructs.
- Don't use Math functions since those work on float only. Hence, typecasting would be needed.
- [Slices](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38731467/pass-array-by-reference-in-golang) are passed by reference in the function call, so no need to specify pointers.

## Array vs Slice
- Slice with dynamic length ( like arraylist in Java ) while Array with constant length.
- [Sample Code](SampleCode/SampleArraySlice.go)

```go
package main

array := [6]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // array
len(array)
slice := make([]int, 6) // slice
slice_1 := []byte{'G', 'E', 'E', 'K', 'S'} // slice

log.Println(reflect.TypeOf(array).Kind()) // array
log.Println(reflect.TypeOf(slice).Kind()) // slice
log.Println(reflect.TypeOf(slice_1).Kind()) //slice
```

## Sample Go Code

```go
package main // folder name is generally specified as package name

import "log"

// Private method since starting character is small case
func findNumber(list []int) {

	var1, var2 := 1, 2 // multiple variables, separated by comma

	log.Println(var1)
	log.Println(var2)
}

// Public method since starting character is capital case
func FindNumber(list []int) (bool, error) {
	return false, nil
}

func main() { // first calling function
}
```
# Method Pointers
- Does the method need to modify the receiver? If it does, the receiver must be a pointer.
```
func (s *MyStruct) pointerMethod() { } // method on pointer. 
func (s MyStruct)  valueMethod()   { } // method on value
```

# [Why does Go have type parameters?](https://go.dev/doc/faq#overloading)
- Type parameters permit what is known as generic programming, in which functions and data structures are defined in terms of types that are specified later, when those functions and data structures are used.
- For example, they make it possible to write a function that returns the minimum of two values of any ordered type, without having to write a separate version for each possible type.

# [Difference b/w make & new](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9320862/why-would-i-make-or-new)
- The make built-in function allocates and initializes an object of type slice, map, or chan (only).
- Like new, the first argument is a type, not a value.
- Unlike new, make's return type is the same as the type of its argument, not a pointer to it.
- The specification of the result depends on the type.

```
themes := make([]*Template, 0)
theme := new(Theme) // Pointer to new Theme object
```

# OOPs
- Go does not support inheritance, however, it does support composition.
