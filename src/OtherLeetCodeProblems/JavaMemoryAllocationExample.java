 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6801676/heap-vs-stack-vs-perm-space
 *
 * Stack
 * - Allocated per Thread
 * - Stores local references and primitives
 * - This is scoped memory - When a method or thread ends, all their data in the stack is lost
 * - Has the fastest access, so a local primitive is faster to use than a local Object
 *
 * Heap
 * - All allocated object instances exist here
 * - Divided into Generations, with the youngest generation being the first place GC looks
 * - Available to all threads so allocations and deallocations should be synchronised
 * - This memory can become fragmented (but you do not usually manage this yourself)
 *
 * PermGen
 * - Stores loaded class information
 * - Stores immutable information (Primatives, interned Strings)
 * - Stores static class members
 *
