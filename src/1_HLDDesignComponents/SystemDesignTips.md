| Understand the system requirements carefully                                 | Identify access patterns, key components in the required architecture like `Data Chunking`, `Data Aggregation` etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Design system with High Throughput & Acceptable Latency                      | While designing the solution, generally we should aim for `MAXIMAL throughput` with `ACCEPTABLE latency`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Design Microservice Based architecture](1_MicroServicesSOA/Readme.md)       | Design system using [Event Driven Architecture](1_MicroServicesSOA/EventDrivenArchitecture.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Choose database based on query patterns                                      | [How to choose database in the system design?](3_DatabaseComponents/3_DecideDatabase/Readme.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Understand read vs write heaviness                                           | If it's a READ heavy microservice, the best decision would be to use [Redis](3_DatabaseComponents/In-Memory-DB/Redis) or `multi-read database instances`.<br/>- If it's a WRITE heavy microservice (`HIGH throughput`), the best decision would be to use either NoSQLDB like [DynamoDB](../2_AWSComponents/6_DatabaseServices/AmazonDynamoDB/Readme.md) (as data store) or [Kafka](4_MessageBrokers/Kafka/Readme.md) (as message broker). |
| Sharding of the database                                                     | To scale the data store horizontally (i.e. improve `write throughput`), [shard the databases]() (through consistent hashing technique etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Partition Key of database                                                    | Decide partition key carefully (to prevent hot partition problem).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Use Leverage Managed Infrastructures like AWS etc.                           | We should use `Leverage Managed Infrastructures` like [Amazon S3](../2_AWSComponents/7_StorageServices/3_ObjectStorageS3/Readme.md), [Amazon Aurora](../2_AWSComponents/6_DatabaseServices/AmazonRDS/AmazonAurora/Readme.md), [DynamoDB](../2_AWSComponents/6_DatabaseServices/AmazonDynamoDB/Readme.md) etc.- Sometimes, we must have to consider `cloud-agnostic approach` (& onPerm customer approach) while designing the solution.    |

| [SQL Tunning](3_DatabaseComponents/SQL-Databases/SQLTuning.md)               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
