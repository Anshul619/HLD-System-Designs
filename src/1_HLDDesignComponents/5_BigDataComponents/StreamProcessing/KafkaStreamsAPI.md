# Kafka Streams API
- [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in [Kafka clusters](../../4_MessageBrokers/Kafka/Readme.md). 
- It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of [Kafka's server-side cluster technology](../../4_MessageBrokers/Kafka/Readme.md).
- An application can use this API to take input streams from one or more topics, process them using streams operations, and generate output streams to transmit to one or more topics.
