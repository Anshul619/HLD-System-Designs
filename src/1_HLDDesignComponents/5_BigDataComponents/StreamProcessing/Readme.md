# Stream processing systems (near-real-time systems)
- Like a [batch processing system](../BatchProcessing/Readme.md), a [stream processor](https://hevodata.com/learn/stream-processing/) consumes inputs and produces outputs (rather than responding to request).
- However, a stream job operates on events shortly after they happen, whereas a batch job operates on a fixed set of input data.
