# Stream processing systems (near-real-time systems)
- [Stream processing](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/stream-processing) is a data management technique that involves ingesting a continuous data stream to quickly analyze, filter, transform or enhance the data in real time.
- Once processed, the data is passed off to an application, data store or another stream processing engine.

| Event                                            | In a stream processing context, a record (mostly in JSON) is more commonly known as an [event](https://tanzu.vmware.com/event-streaming), <br/>- but it is essentially the same thing: [a small, self- contained, immutable object](https://tanzu.vmware.com/event-streaming) containing the details of something that happened at some point in time. | The thing that happened might be an action that a user took, such as viewing a page or making a purchase.<br/>-  It might also originate from a machine, such as a periodic measurement from a temperature sensor, or a CPU utilization metric. |
| Producer (also known as a publisher or sender)   | In streaming terminology, an event is generated once by a producer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
