# Stream processing systems (near-real-time systems)
- [Stream processing](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/stream-processing) is a data management technique that involves ingesting a continuous data stream to quickly analyze, filter, transform or enhance the data in real time.
- Once processed, the data is passed off to an application, data store or another stream processing engine.
