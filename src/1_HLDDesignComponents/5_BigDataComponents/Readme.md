| [Batch Processing](BatchProcessing/Readme.md)   | It involves [MapReduce jobs](BatchProcessing/MapReduce.md) which runs at certain frequency to transform the data.   |
| [Stream Processing](StreamProcessing/Readme.md) | It involves processing data in near-real time.                                                                      |

# Batch vs Stream Processing
- Like a [batch processing system](BatchProcessing/Readme.md), a [stream processor](StreamProcessing/Readme.md) consumes inputs and produces outputs (rather than responding to request).
- However, a stream job operates on events shortly after they happen, whereas a batch job operates on a fixed set of input data.
