# Canary Deployments
- [Canary or Staged Deployments](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.canary-deployment.en.html) are a pattern for rolling out releases to a subset of users or servers.
- The idea is to first deploy the change to a small subset of servers, test it and then rollout the change out to rest of the servers.
