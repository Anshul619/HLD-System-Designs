# Docker
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 
- Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. 
- With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
- [Amazon ECR](../../../2_AWSComponents/4_ComputeServices/AmazonECS/AmazonECR.md) can be used to store, manage & deploy docker container images. (An alternative to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/))

# Docker Compose
- In [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/08_using_compose/), you can specify image, environment variables etc.
- It should create the corresponding micro containers for those different microservices.

![](assets/Docker_Concepts.png)

## Up
- Start up the application stack using the `docker-compose up` command. 
- We’ll add the -d flag to run everything in the background.

````shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sample-service.yaml -f service/docker-compose.service.yaml up -d
````

## Down
- When you’re ready to tear it all down, simply run `docker-compose down` or hit the trash can on the Docker Dashboard for the entire app. 
- The containers will stop and the network will be removed.

````shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sample-service.yaml -f service/docker-compose.service.yaml down
````

## Logs
- Let’s look at the logs using the `docker-compose logs -f` command. 
- You’ll see the logs from each of the services interleaved into a single stream. 
- This is incredibly useful when you want to watch for timing-related issues. 
- The -f flag “follows” the log, so will give you live output as it’s generated.

````shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sample-service.yaml -f service/docker-compose.service.yaml` logs -f
````

## Specify Runtime options with Memory, CPUs, and GPUs

````shell
docker run -it \
--cpu-rt-runtime=950000 \
--ulimit rtprio=99 \
--cap-add=sys_nice \
debian:jessie
````

# Docker Image Layers
- [Each layer is an image itself](https://vsupalov.com/docker-image-layers/), just one without a human-assigned tag.
- [Each instruction in a Dockerfile results in a layer](). (Except for multi-stage builds, where usually only the layers in the final image are pushed, or when an image is squashed to a single layer).
- They have auto-generated IDs though.
- Each layer stores the changes compared to the image it’s based on.
- An image can consist of a single layer (that’s often the case when the squash command was used).
- Layers are used to avoid transferring redundant information and skip build steps which have not changed (according to the Docker cache).

# The underlying technology
- Docker is written in the [Go programming language](../../../5_ProgrammingLanguages/1_GoLang) and takes advantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality. 
- Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. 
- When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.
