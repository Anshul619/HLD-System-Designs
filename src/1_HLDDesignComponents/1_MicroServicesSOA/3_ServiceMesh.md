# Common Issues with Microservices
- Uniformity of logs, metrics and traces
- Load balancing
- Weight and shift traffic for deployments
- Minimize application code impact
- Decouple service teams

While itâ€™s technically possible to do all of this with just traditional networking practices, the difficulty and time necessary to manage these issues quickly leads us to look for a better solution.
- That solution is a service mesh.
- We install a small, lightweight proxy server next to each and every container, and then wire up a separate overlay network between these proxy servers on top of the existing networking provided by the infrastructure layer such as AWS VPC.

# Features
- First, it sits between all services and manages and observes traffic.
