# Introduction
- [gRPC](https://grpc.io) is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call framework that can run in any environment.

gRPC is contract-based, 
- A Contract needs to be available on both sides of communication to make sense of data going between them. 
- To define the contracts, gRPC uses a declarative language called [Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

# :thumbsup: Advantages of gRPC

## Built on HTTP 2 Instead of HTTP 1.1 
- In HTTP 2, when a microservice receives multiple requests from more than one client, it achieves multiplexing by serving many requests and responses simultaneously.

## Protobuf instead of JSON/XML
- [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) is the contract itself and supports code-generation for many of the most popular programming languages.

## According to widely-cited tests, gRPC API connections are considerably faster than REST API connections.
- In fact, its reported that [GPRC is 7 to 10 times faster than REST](https://blog.dreamfactory.com/grpc-vs-rest-how-does-grpc-compare-with-traditional-rest-apis/).

# :thumbsdown: Problems with gRPC
- gRPC is currently much less popular than REST, and experienced developers are harder to find.
- gRPC is not a native solution for customer-facing web applications because it requires `HTTP/2, which is not fully supported by browsers`. 
- For example, client streaming and bidirectional streaming are not supported in browsers at all.
- However, thereâ€™s a gRPC-Web project that enables using browser-to-backend communication over gRPC without creating a REST proxy.
