# [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
- Dynamically get the data columns as needed.
  - Client has control of what data it needs from server?
- GraphQL is schema less.
- `GraphQL is faster than REST` because as you can pick the fields you want to query, so the request will always be the smallest possible. 
- Additionally, with GraphQL, you can enquire multiple entities in one request, and because less bits will be transferred over the wire so your projects will perform faster than while using REST.
