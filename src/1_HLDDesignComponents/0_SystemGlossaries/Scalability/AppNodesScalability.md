# Cluster capacity
- In general, a cluster (for ex. [Kubernates cluster](../../6_DevOps/Kubernates.md)) can be seen as abstracting a set of individual nodes as a big "super node".
- The total compute capacity (in terms of CPU and memory) of this super node is the sum of all the constituent nodes' capacities.

There are 2 ways to design the cluster
- Few large nodes
- Many small nodes
