# Cluster capacity
- In general, a cluster (for ex. [Kubernates cluster](../../6_DevOps/Kubernates.md)) can be seen as abstracting a set of individual nodes as a big "super node".
- The total compute capacity (in terms of CPU and memory) of this super node is the sum of all the constituent nodes' capacities.

# Different Node Sizing Strategies

Given a desired target capacity (i.e. a combination of CPU cores & RAM) of a cluster, you have three node-sizing strategies to choose from,
- Many Small Nodes: All small nodes of the same capacity
- Few Large Nodes: All large nodes of the same capacity
