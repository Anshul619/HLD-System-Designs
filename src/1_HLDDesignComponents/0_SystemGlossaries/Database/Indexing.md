# Indexing
- An [index](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/indexing-in-databases-set-1/) is a data structure that is used to find and access data available in a table of a database faster.
- Generally, an index has two sections: the search key and the data reference.

# :+1: Advantages of Indexes
- Indexes are used to speed up lookups (log-time instead of scanning the entire table) and to keep the data in memory. This will increase performance of SQL queries.
- Indices are usually represented as self-balancing B-tree that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

# :-1: Disadvantages of Indexes
- Placing an index can keep the data in memory, requiring more space.
- Writes could also be slower since the index also needs to be updated. Hence, we should create only required indexes.
- When loading large amounts of data, it might be faster to disable indices, load the data, then rebuild the indices.

| Local Secondary Index  | A local secondary index is "local" in the sense that every partition of a local secondary index is scoped to a base table partition that has the same partition key value.                                                                                                              | Eventual consistency only<br/>- [Amazon DynamoDB](../../../2_AWSComponents/6_DatabaseServices/AmazonDynamoDB/Readme.md) states that its global secondary indexes are updated within a fraction of a second in normal circumstances. | [Amazon DynamoDB](../../../2_AWSComponents/6_DatabaseServices/AmazonDynamoDB/Readme.md), MongoDB, Casandra etc. |
| Global Secondary Index | A global secondary index is considered "global" because queries on the index can span all of the data in the base table, across all partitions.<br/>- A global secondary index is stored in its own partition space away from the base table and scales separately from the base table. | Can choose either eventual consistency or strong consistency.                                                                                                                                                                       | [Amazon DynamoDB](../../../2_AWSComponents/6_DatabaseServices/AmazonDynamoDB/Readme.md), MongoDB etc.           |
