# Network Design
A life-cycle network design defines the network, removes assumptions, and helps to create a baseline.
- [Network design documents and diagrams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/establishing-your-cloud-foundation-on-aws/network-designing-and-planning.html) visualize the components of a network, including routers, firewalls, and devices, and also show how those components interact.

The network design process follows these steps:
- Identify initial and new requirements.
- Compare the current network to the requirements.
- Design the network, add in hardware, software, configurations at a high level, then in detail.
- Deploy the network.
- Monitor, review, and improve.
