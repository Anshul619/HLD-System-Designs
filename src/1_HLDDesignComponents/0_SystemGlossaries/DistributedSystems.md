# Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems
- [Scalability](Scalability.md)
- [High Availability](HighAvailability.md)
  - It is a simple measure of the percentage of time that a system, service, or a machine remains operational under normal conditions.
- [Reliability - Fault Tolerance, Disaster Recovery](FaultTolerance&DisasterRecovery.md)
  - A distributed system is considered reliable if it keeps delivering its services even when one or several of its software or hardware components fail.
- [Efficiency - Latency, Throughput](LatencyThroughput.md)
  - Serviceability or Manageability - Serviceability or manageability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained.
