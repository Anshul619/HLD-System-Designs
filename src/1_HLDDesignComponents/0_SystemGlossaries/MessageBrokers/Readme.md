| Stream                                             | Continuous data that is incrementally made available over time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Logs, User activity etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Event](EventDrivenArchitecture.md)                | A record (mostly in JSON) is more commonly known as an [event](https://tanzu.vmware.com/event-streaming), <br/>- but it is essentially the same thing: [a small, self- contained, immutable object](https://tanzu.vmware.com/event-streaming) containing the details of something that happened at some point in time. | The thing that happened might be an action that a user took, such as viewing a page or making a purchase.<br/>-  It might also originate from a machine, such as a periodic measurement from a temperature sensor, or a CPU utilization metric. |
| Producer (also known as a publisher or sender)     | An event is generated once by a producer. i.e. Producer writes event into the topics (1 or more).                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Consumers (subscribers or recipients)              | Event processed by consumer. <br/>- A consumer can subscribe (listen) to the topics (1 or more) and read data from those in the message broker.<br/>- Each consumer in a consumer group will be responsible for reading a subset of the partitions of each subject to which they have subscribed.                           | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Topic or stream                                    | Related events are usually grouped together into a topic or stream.<br/>- Topic is a category or feed where messages (or events) would be saved and published.<br/>- Topics are logically collections of partitions (the physical files).<br/>- A broker contains some partitions for a topic.                         | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Message Brokers](../../4_MessageBrokers)          | Producer writes messages to the broker & consumer receives them by reading from broker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
