# Why System Reliability is so important?
In some cloud platforms such as [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](../../../2_AWSComponents/Readme.md),
- It is fairly common for virtual machine instances to become unavailable without warning, as the platforms are designed to prioritize flexibility and elasticity over single-machine reliability.
- Hence, [Fault-Tolerance](FaultTolerance.md), [High Availability](HighAvailability.md) plays an important role.
