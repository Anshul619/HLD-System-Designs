# :star: [Event Driven Architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/event-driven-architecture/)
- An event-driven architecture uses events to trigger and communicate between loosely coupled services and is common in modern applications built with [microservices](../1_MicroServices).
- [Message brokers](../4_MessageBrokers) like [Kafka](../4_MessageBrokers/Kafka.md), [RabbitMQ](../4_MessageBrokers/RabbitMQ.md) etc., are used in the event-driven architecture.

## Examples of an event
- An update like an item being placed in a shopping cart on an e-commerce website.
- Item purchased, its price, and a delivery address.
- A notification that an order was shipped.
