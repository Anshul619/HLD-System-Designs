# Docker
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. (Package it once and leverage it across environments)
- Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. 
- With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
- [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)](../../../2_AWSComponents/4a_ContainerOrchestrationServices/AmazonECR.md) can be used to store, manage & deploy docker container images. (An alternative to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/))

The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon. |

# Docker Run vs Docker Compose
- docker run is entirely command line based, while [docker-compose](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Docker-run-vs-docker-compose-Whats-the-difference) reads configuration data from a YAML file.
- docker run can only start one container at a time, while [docker-compose](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Docker-run-vs-docker-compose-Whats-the-difference) will configure and run multiple.

# Docker Image Layers
- [Each layer is an image itself](https://vsupalov.com/docker-image-layers/), just one without a human-assigned tag.
- [Each instruction in a Dockerfile results in a layer](). (Except for multi-stage builds, where usually only the layers in the final image are pushed, or when an image is squashed to a single layer).
- They have auto-generated IDs though.
- Each layer stores the changes compared to the image itâ€™s based on.
- An image can consist of a single layer (thatâ€™s often the case when the squash command was used).
- Layers are used to avoid transferring redundant information and skip build steps which have not changed (according to the Docker cache).

# The underlying technology
- Docker is written in the [Go programming language](../../../5_ProgrammingLanguages/1_GoLang) and takes advantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality. 
- Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. 
- When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.
