# Apache Yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)
- Manages and monitors cluster nodes and resource usage. 
- It schedules jobs and tasks.
- It's part of [Apache Hadoop](../5_BigDataComponents/ApacheHadoop)
- Yarn doesn't support containerization ( docker etc. ). Hence its specifically for Hadoop deployments.
