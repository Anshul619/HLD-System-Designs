| Core Design                                                                       | Designed to handle [message streams](../5_BigDataComponents/ETLServices/StreamProcessing/Readme.md) | Designed for [long-term durability](../3_DatabaseComponents/1_Glossaries/ACIDTransactions/Durability.md), data search & querying. |
| [Durability](../3_DatabaseComponents/1_Glossaries/ACIDTransactions/Durability.md) | Data is deleted once its consumed or retained for a certain period.                                 | Long-term storage<br/>- Data is stored until its explicitly deleted.                                                              |
