|  Lifetime Of Messages                 | As per the retension policy, messages are retained in Kafka. And `these can be replayed`.              | Once message is consumed and acknowledgement is sent, it would be removed from RabbitMQ message queue.                                                               | Message can be stored in SQS for short duration of time ( max 14 days, default 4 days ). Once message is consumed, it would be removed from SQS message queue. | No persistence. When an SNS Topic receives an event notification (from publisher), it is broadcasted (`fan-out`) to all Subscribers (Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, HTTPS endpoints etc.) | Message would be removed once consumed.                                                       |
