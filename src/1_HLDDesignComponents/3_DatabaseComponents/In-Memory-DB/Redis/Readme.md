# Introduction
- [Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)](https://redis.com/) is a popular in-memory data platform used as a cache that can be deployed on-premises, across clouds, and hybrid environments.

# General Use Cases

| Use Case                                                                      | Data Type          | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| [Caching](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/caching/)                     | All                | One of the advantage of cache is to remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed uo the reads.<br/>- [LRU is the default eviction policy](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/databases/configure/eviction-policy/) in redis. |
| [Session Storage](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/session-management/)  | All                | In order to address scalability and to provide a shared data storage for sessions that can be accessible from any individual web server, you can abstract the HTTP sessions from the web servers themselves.                          |
| [Distributed Locks](https://redis.io/docs/manual/patterns/distributed-locks/) | Strings            | We can use a Redis string to acquire locks among distributed services.<br/>- Example - [Twitter Hit Counter](../../../../3_HLDDesignProblemsUC/TwitterHitCounterDesign/Readme.md)                                                       |
| [Rate Limiting](../../../../3_HLDDesignProblemsUC/RateLimiterAPI/Readme.md)     | All                | We can apply a rate limiter for certain user IPs.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Rank/Leaderboard](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/leaderboards/)       | SortedSet          | We can use SortedSet to sort the articles.<br/>- Example - Best sellers, ranking etc.                                                                                                                                                 |
| [GeoSpatial](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/geospatial/)                    | GeoSpatial Indexes | Redis geospatial indexes let you store coordinates and search for them. This data structure is useful for finding nearby points within a given radius or bounding box.                                                                |
| [Queues](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/messaging/)                    | Lists              | We can use List for a message queue.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Speed - 100K queries per second                                            | Since Redis uses in-memory for storage, it is very fast.<br/>- Mostly O(1) behavior, to get data from redis.<br/>- Generally, [Redis is 5 times faster than database](../../../SystemEstimationTips.md#latency-comparison-numbers).                             |
| Redis Transaction lock                                                     | Using [Redis Transaction lock](https://redis.io/docs/reference/patterns/distributed-locks/), we can achieve [atomicity](../../1_Glossaries/ACIDTransactions/Atomicity.md) on the Redis operations (i.e. set/increase the key, add/remove elements from set, increase counter etc.). |
| Multiple data types supported                                              | [Multiple data types](https://redis.io/docs/manual/data-types/) are supported in Redis.                                                                                                                                                                         |

| [Replication Supported (Leader-Follower)](RedisLeaderFollowReplication.md) | This helps in both High-Availability and read-scalability of redis.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Sharding Supported (using Redis Cluster)](RedisCluster.md)                | This helps in write scalability of redis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Redis vs Memcache](../RedisVsMemcache.md)                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Data Persistence                                                           | It's generally suggested to turn off persistence on the master node, so that you get consistent low latency response time.<br/>- No forking to disk will be done.<br/>- No wasted I/O.                                                                          |

| :star: [Strings](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/strings/)         | [Strings](https://www.w3resource.com/redis/redis-data-types.php) are Redis `most basic data type`.<br/>- Option1 - `Stringify and then store JSON` in Redis, as string datatype.<br/>- Option2 - Use [Redis JSON](https://redis.io/docs/stack/json/), which supports JSON value in Redis.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :star: [Sorted sets](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/sorted-sets/) | Every member of a [Sorted Set](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/sorted-sets/) is associated with a score, that is used to keep the Sorted Set in order, from the smallest to the greatest score.<br/>- While members are unique, scores may be repeated.<br/>- [Create a Redis Leaderboard with Golang](https://www.vultr.com/docs/create-a-redis-leaderboard-with-golang/)                                                                                               |
 | [Hashes](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/hashes/)                  | Redis Hashes are maps between `string fields` and `string values`, so they are the perfect data type to `represent objects` (e.g. A User with a number of fields like name, surname, age, and so forth).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Sets](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/sets/)                      | Redis Sets are an unordered collection of Strings. <br/>- It is possible to add, remove, and test for existence of members in `O(1)` (constant time regardless of the number of elements contained inside the Set).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Lists](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/lists/)                    | Redis Lists are simply lists of strings, sorted by `insertion order`.<br/>- The main features of Redis Lists from the point of view of time complexity are the `support for constant time ( O(1) ) insertion and deletion of elements near the head and tail`, even with many millions of inserted items.<br/>- Accessing elements is very fast near the extremes of the list but is slow if you try accessing the middle of a very big list, as it is an O(N) operation. |
| [GeoSpatial Indexes](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/geospatial/)  | Redis geospatial indexes let you store coordinates and search for them. This data structure is useful for finding nearby points within a given radius or bounding box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [BitMaps](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/bitmaps/)                | Redis bitfields let you set, increment, and get integer values of arbitrary bit length.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Streams](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/streams/)                | A Redis stream is a data structure that acts like an [append-only log](../../2_DataStructuresDB/AppendOnlyProperty.md) but also implements several operations to overcome some of the limits of a typical append-only log.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
