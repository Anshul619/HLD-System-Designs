# Introduction
- [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) uses a log structured database engine, written entirely in C++, for maximum performance. 
- Keys and values are just arbitrarily-sized byte streams.
- RocksDB is optimized for fast, low latency storage such as flash drives and high-speed disk drives. 
- RocksDB exploits the full potential of high read/write rates offered by flash or RAM.
