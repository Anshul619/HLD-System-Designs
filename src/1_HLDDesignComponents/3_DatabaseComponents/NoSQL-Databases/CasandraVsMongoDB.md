| Basis                                                               | [Casandra](ApacheCasandra.md)                                                                                                                               | [MongoDB](MongoDB/Readme.md)                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DB Type                                                             | Wide-Column DB Store                                                                                                                                        | Document DB Store                                                                                                                      |
| Writing Scalablity                                                  | :+1: Writing scalability in Cassandra is very high and efficient. <br/>- Due to [Append-Only nature](../../0_SystemGlossaries/AppendOnlyDataStructure.md).  | Writing scalability is limited in MongoDB.                                                                                             |
| Read Performance                                                    | :+1: Read performance is highly efficient in Cassandra as it takes O(1) time.                                                                               | Read performance is not that fast in MongoDB when compared to Cassandra.                                                               |
| Data Format                                                         | Cassandra only supports JSON data format.                                                                                                                   | MongoDB supports both [JSON and BSON data formats](https://www.mongodb.com/json-and-bson).                                             |
| Replication Method                                                  | The replication method that Cassandra supports is Selectable Replication Factor.                                                                            | The replication method that MongoDB supports is Master Slave Replication                                                               |
| [ACID Support](../../0_SystemGlossaries/ACIDPropertyTransaction.md) | [Cassandra does not provides ACID transactions](../../0_SystemGlossaries/ACIDPropertyTransaction.md) but can be tuned to support ACID properties.           | :+1: MongoDB provides [Multi-document ACID transactions](../../0_SystemGlossaries/ACIDPropertyTransaction.md) with snapshot isolation. |
| Used by                                                             | Famous companies like Hulu, Instagram, Intuit, Netflix, Reddit, etc uses Cassandra.                                                                         | :+1: Famous companies like Adobe, Amadeus, Lyft, ViaVarejo, Craftbase, etc uses MongoDB.                                               |
| Secondary Indexes                                                   | Cassandra has only cursory support for secondary indexes i.e secondary indexing is restricted.                                                              | MongoDB supports the concept of secondary indexes.                                                                                     |
