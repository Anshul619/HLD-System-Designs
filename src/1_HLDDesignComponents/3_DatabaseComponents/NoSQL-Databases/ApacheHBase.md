# Intro
- An open source, non-relational, versioned database that runs on top of [Amazon S3](../../../2_AWSComponents/7_StorageServices/AmazonS3.md) (using [EMRFS](../../../2_AWSComponents/4_ComputeServices/AmazonEMR.md)) or the [Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)](../../8_BigDataComponents/ApacheHadoop/ApacheHDFS.md). 
- [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) is a massively scalable, distributed big data store built for `random, strictly consistent, real-time access for tables with billions of rows and millions of columns`.
