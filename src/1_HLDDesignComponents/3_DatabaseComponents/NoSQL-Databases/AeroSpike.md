# Introduction
- Flash-optimized in-memory open source NoSQL database. 
- Aerospike is an open-source, modern database built from the ground up to push the limits of flash storage, processors and networks. 
- It was designed to operate with [predictable low latency at high throughput](../../0_SystemGlossaries/LatencyThroughput.md) with uncompromising reliability â€“ both [high availability](../../0_SystemGlossaries/HighAvailability.md) and [ACID guarantees](../../0_SystemGlossaries/ACIDPropertyTransaction.md).
