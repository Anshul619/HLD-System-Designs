# Storage volume types

| Volume type        | Key Strength                        | Use Cases                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SSD-backed volumes | High read/write with small I/O size | SSD-backed volumes optimized for transactional workloads involving frequent read/write operations with small I/O size, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS. |
| HDD-backed volumes | Large I/O size                      | HDD-backed volumes optimized for large streaming workloads where throughput (measured in MiB/s) is a better performance measure than IOPS.                               |

| Storage type | Application storage option | Examples                                                                                                                                                         | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Hot Storage  | SSD (fast storage)         | [Amazon Dynamo DB](../../../2_AWSComponents/6_DatabaseServices/AmazonDynamoDB/Readme.md), [Amazon Aurora](../../../2_AWSComponents/6_DatabaseServices/AmazonRDS) | [Hot storage]() is data that is accessed frequently.<br/>- This could be data that is being actively used by employees or customers.                                                                                                                  |
| Warm Storage | HDD                        | -                                                                                                                                                                | [Warm storage]() is data that is accessed less frequently.<br/>- This could be data that is used for reporting or analytics.<br/>- It doesnâ€™t need to be accessed as quickly as hot data, so it can be stored on slightly slower, capacity-optimized. |
| Cold Storage | Object Storage             | [Amazon S3](../../../2_AWSComponents/7_StorageServices/3_ObjectStorageS3/Readme.md)                                                                              | [Cold storage]() is data that is rarely accessed.<br/>- It can be stored on even slower, `cheap and deep` storage.                                                                                                                                    |
