| [Identity-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_id-based)                            | Attach managed and inline policies to IAM identities (users, groups to which users belong, or roles). <br/>- Identity-based policies grant permissions to an identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Resource-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_resource-based)                      | Resource-based policies grant permissions to the principal that is specified in the policy. Attach inline policies to resources. <br/>- Principals can be in the same account as the resource or in other accounts.<br/>- Common Examples -  [Amazon S3 bucket policies](../../../7_StorageServices/3_ObjectStorageS3/S3Bucket.md) and [IAM role trust policies](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/). |
| [Permissions boundaries for IAM entities](PermissionBoundary.md)                                                                              | A [permissions boundary](PermissionBoundary.md) is an advanced feature for using a managed policy to set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity/principal (user/role).<br/>- The entity can perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.                                                                                                |
| [AWS Organization Service control policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) | Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in [your organization](../../4_MultipleAccounts/AWSOrganization.md).<br/>- Restricts permissions for entities in an AWS account, including AWS account root users. <br/>- SCPs do not affect any [service-linked role](IAMRoles.md).                                                                                                      |
| [Session policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)                                    | Session policies are [inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html) that you pass as a parameter when you programmatically create a temporary session for a role or federated user.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Trust Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/)                                               | The [trust policy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/) defines which principals can assume the role, and under which conditions. <br/>- A trust policy is a specific type of resource-based policy for [IAM roles](IAMRoles.md).                                                                                                                                                                      |

| [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html)      | An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. <br/>- Standalone policy means that the policy has its own Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that includes the policy name.                                                                                                 |
| [Customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html) | You can create standalone policies in your own AWS account that you can attach to principal entities (users, groups, and roles). <br/>- Notice that the same policy can be attached to multiple principal entities—for example, the same DynamoDB-books-app policy is attached to two different IAM roles. |
| [Inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html)           | An inline policy is a policy created for a single IAM identity (a user, group, or role). Inline policies maintain a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and an identity.                                                                                                                       |
