# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) allows an administrator to provide multiple users and groups with granular access.
- Various user groups and users may require varying levels of access to the various resources that have been developed.
- We may assign roles to users and create roles with defined access levels using IAM.
- It further gives us Federated Access, which allows us to grant applications and users access to resources without having to create IAM Roles.
- Each AWS account can have max 5000 IAM users.

| [Trust Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/)           | The trust policy defines which principals can assume the role, and under which conditions. <br/>- A trust policy is a specific type of resource-based policy for IAM roles.                                                                                                                                                          |

| [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html)      | An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. <br/>- Standalone policy means that the policy has its own Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that includes the policy name.                                                                                                 |
| [Customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html) | You can create standalone policies in your own AWS account that you can attach to principal entities (users, groups, and roles). <br/>- Notice that the same policy can be attached to multiple principal entities—for example, the same DynamoDB-books-app policy is attached to two different IAM roles. |
| [Inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html)           | An inline policy is a policy created for a single IAM identity (a user, group, or role).

## Permission Boundary
- A [permissions boundary](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/delegate-permission-management-to-developers-using-iam-permissions-boundaries/) is an advanced feature that allows you to limit the maximum permissions that a principal can have.
- As the IAM administrator, you can define one or more permissions boundaries using managed policies and allow your employee to create a principal with this boundary.
- The employee can then attach a permissions policy to this principal. 
- However, the effective permissions of the principal are the intersection of the permissions boundary and permissions policy.
