# [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)
- AWS IAM allows an administrator to provide multiple users and groups with granular access.
- Various user groups and users may require varying levels of access to the various resources that have been developed.
- We may assign roles to users and create roles with defined access levels using IAM.
- It further gives us Federated Access, which allows us to grant applications and users access to resources without having to create IAM Roles.
