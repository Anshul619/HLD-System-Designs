# AWS Shield
- [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc) is a managed `Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)` protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. 
- AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection. 
- There are two tiers of AWS Shield - Standard and Advanced.
