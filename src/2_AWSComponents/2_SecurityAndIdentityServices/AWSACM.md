# AWS Certificate Manager
- Use [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) to provision, manage, and deploy public and private SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources. ACM removes the time-consuming manual process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates.
