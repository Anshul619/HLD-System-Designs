# Security Group vs Network ACL

| Feature       | [Security Group](VPCSecurityGroup.md)                                                                                                                   | [Network ACL](SubnetVPCNetworkACL.md)                                                                                                                                                             |

| Stateliness   | [Stateful](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stateful)<br/>- If traffic is allowed in, the outbound response to that traffic is allowed out automatically. | [Stateless](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stateless#English)<br/>- [Both inbound & outbound traffic needs to be allowed](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/resolve-connection-sg-acl-inbound). |

| Explicit Deny | [Security groups](VPCSecurityGroup.md) have a hidden explicit deny, which means that anything that is not explicitly allowed is denied.                 | By default, network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic.                                                                                                                                  |
