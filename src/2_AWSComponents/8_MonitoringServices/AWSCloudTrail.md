# [AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)
- `Cloudtrail` is a service that `logs AWS account activity and Amazon Route 53 API` usage for risk auditing, compliance and monitoring.
- CloudTrail records user API activity on your account and allows you to access information about the activity.
- Using CloudTrail, you can get full details about API actions such as the identity of the caller, time of the call, request parameters, and response elements.
- CloudTrail saves log files of these requests to an `Amazon S3 bucket`.
- You can use information in the CloudTrail log files to determine which requests were sent to Amazon Route 53, the IP address that the request was sent from, who sent the request, when it was sent, and more.
- It lets you perform security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing of your AWS environment as well. 
- The best part about this service is that it enables you to `configure it to send notifications via AWS SNS when new logs are delivered`.
