# AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO)
- [An IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) helps you securely create or connect your workforce identities and manage their access centrally across AWS accounts and applications.
- [IAM Identity Center]() is the recommended approach for workforce authentication and authorization on AWS for organizations of any size and type.
- It helps to keep [AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) groups and users]() in sync with [Google Workspace directory]() using [idp-scim-sync plugin](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/us-east-1/889836709304/idp-scim-sync).
