# Amazon EventBridge (formerly called Cloudwatch Events)
- [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) is a serverless event bus that lets you receive, filter, transform, route, and deliver events. 
- Using [Amazon EventBridge](), we can build [event-driven applications at scale](../../1_HLDDesignComponents/1_MicroServicesSOA) across AWS, existing systems, or SaaS applications.
- It uses the [Amazon CloudWatch Events API](../8_MonitoringServices/AmazonCloudWatch.md), but also includes more functionality, like the ability to ingest events from SaaS apps.

# Amazon EventBridge rules
- [An event bridge rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.html) matches incoming events and sends them to targets for processing. 
- A single rule can send an event to multiple targets, which then run in parallel. 
- Rules are based either on an event pattern or a schedule. 
- [An event pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.html) defines the event structure and the fields that a rule matches. 
- Rules that are based on a schedule perform an action at regular intervals.
