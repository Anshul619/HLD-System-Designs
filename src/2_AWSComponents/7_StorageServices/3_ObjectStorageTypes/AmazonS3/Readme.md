# Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is an object store (flat-structure), meaning it is a higher layer data storage system, essentially [it is a database "blob" storage](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32166/blob-storage), storing data in an underlying simple database as an object.
- It's designed for [WRITE once READ many access i.e. append-only data structure](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/Database/AppendOnlyDataStructure.md), perfect for [Static content](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/CDNs/StaticContentWithCDN.md).
- It's [distributed](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/Readme.md) and offers a very high level of redundancy i.e. [data is stored in 3 AZs within a specific region](../../../AWS-Global-Architecture-Region-AZ.md).

| [Static content](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/CDNs/StaticContentWithCDN.md)  | Because of the limitless scaling, the support for large files, and the fact that you access any object over the web at any time, Amazon S3 is the perfect place to store static content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## :star: Amazon S3 + Amazon CloudFront: A Match Made in the Cloud
- Instead of [directly accessing the S3 resource](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/amazon-s3-amazon-cloudfront-a-match-made-in-the-cloud/), we should use [CloudFront distribution](../../../1_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/1_EdgeNetworking/AmazonCloudFront.md) in the middle (which acts as a [CDN](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/CDNs/CDNs.md))

## Hosting a static website using Amazon S3 & CloudFront
- You can use [Amazon S3 to host a static website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html).
- [On a static website, individual webpages include static content](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/CDNs/StaticContentWithCDN.md).
- They might also contain client-side scripts.

By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server-side processing, including server-side scripts, such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET.
- [Amazon S3]() does not support server-side scripting, but AWS has other resources for hosting dynamic websites.

# S3 Cli
- It's a best practice to use [aws s3 commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/) for multipart uploads and downloads, because these [aws s3 commands automatically perform multipart uploading and downloading based on the file size](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-multipart-upload-cli).
