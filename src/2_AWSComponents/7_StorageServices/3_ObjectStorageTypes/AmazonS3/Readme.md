# Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is an object store (flat-structure), meaning it is a higher layer data storage system, essentially [it is a database "blob" storage](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32166/blob-storage), storing data in an underlying simple database as an object.
- It's designed for [WRITE once READ many access i.e. append-only data structure](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/Database/AppendOnlyDataStructure.md), perfect for [Static content](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/CDNs/StaticContentWithCDN.md).
- It's [distributed](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/Readme.md) and offers a very high level of redundancy i.e. [data is stored in 3 AZs within a specific region](../../../AWS-Global-Architecture-Region-AZ.md).

## :star: Amazon S3 + Amazon CloudFront: A Match Made in the Cloud
- Instead of [directly accessing the S3 resource](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/amazon-s3-amazon-cloudfront-a-match-made-in-the-cloud/), we should use [CloudFront distribution](../../../1_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/1_EdgeNetworking/AmazonCloudFront.md) in the middle (which acts as a [CDN](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/CDNs/CDNs.md))

## Hosting a static website using Amazon S3 & CloudFront
- You can use [Amazon S3 to host a static website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html).
- [On a static website, individual webpages include static content](../../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/CDNs/StaticContentWithCDN.md).
- They might also contain client-side scripts.

By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server-side processing, including server-side scripts, such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET.
- [Amazon S3]() does not support server-side scripting, but AWS has other resources for hosting dynamic websites.

# S3 Cli
- It's a best practice to use [aws s3 commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/) for multipart uploads and downloads, because these [aws s3 commands automatically perform multipart uploading and downloading based on the file size](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-multipart-upload-cli).
