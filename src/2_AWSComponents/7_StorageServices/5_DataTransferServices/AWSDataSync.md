# AWS Data Sync
- [AWS DataSync](https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/) provides data copy services between on-premises storage and AWS Cloud storage (like [Amazon S3](../3_ObjectStorageTypes/AmazonS3/Readme.md))
- AWS DataSync supports asynchronous or one-direction at a time transfers between on-premises file systems to supported AWS Storage services in the AWS Cloud. 
- Data and file systems include NFS file shares, SMB file shares, and self-managed object storage. 
- DataSync also supports asynchronous data transfers between supported AWS Storage resources within the AWS Cloud.
