# AWS Snowcone
- [AWS Snowcone](https://aws.amazon.com/snowcone/) is the smallest member of the AWS Snow Family. 
- The device weighs under five pounds. 
- Its size makes it ideal for use cases with limited space requirements or that require maximum portability.

# Snowmobile
- Each [Snowmobile](https://aws.amazon.com/snowmobile/faqs/) has a total capacity of up to 100 petabytes. 
- To migrate large datasets of 10PB or more in a single location, you should use Snowmobile. 
- For datasets less than 10PB or distributed in multiple locations, you should use Snowball.
