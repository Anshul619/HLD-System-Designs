# Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is an object store (flat-structure), meaning it is a higher layer data storage system, essentially [it is a database "blob" storage](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32166/blob-storage), storing data in an underlying simple database as an object.
- It's designed for [WRITE once READ many access i.e. append-only data structure](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/Database/AppendOnlyDataStructure.md), perfect for [Static content](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/CDNs/StaticContentWithCDN.md).
- It's [distributed](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/Readme.md) and offers a very high level of redundancy i.e. [data is stored in 3 AZs within a specific region](../../AWS-Global-Architecture-Region-AZ.md).

| Backup and storage | Amazon S3 is a natural place to back up files because it is highly redundant. As mentioned in the last unit, AWS stores your EBS snapshots in S3 to take advantage of its high availability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Media hosting      | Because you can store unlimited objects, and each individual object can be up to 5 TBs, Amazon S3 is an ideal location to host video, photo, and music uploads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Software delivery  | You can use Amazon S3 to host your software applications that customers can download.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Data lakes         | Amazon S3 is an optimal foundation for a data lake because of its virtually unlimited scalability. <br/>- You can increase storage from gigabytes to petabytes of content, paying only for what you use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Data Catalog       | You can create the comprehensive data catalog by using standard AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES). <br/>- At a high level, you can use Lambda triggers to populate DynamoDB tables with object names and metadata. <br/>- When those objects are put into Amazon S3 then Amazon ES is used to search for specific assets, related metadata, and data classifications. |
| Static websites    | You can configure your S3 bucket to host a static website of HTML, CSS, and client-side scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Static content     | Because of the limitless scaling, the support for large files, and the fact that you access any object over the web at any time, Amazon S3 is the perfect place to store static content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## :star: Amazon S3 + Amazon CloudFront: A Match Made in the Cloud
- Instead of [directly accessing the S3 resource](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/amazon-s3-amazon-cloudfront-a-match-made-in-the-cloud/), we should use [CloudFront distribution](../../1_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/EdgeNetworking/AmazonCloudFront.md) in the middle (which acts as a [CDN](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/CDNs/CDNs.md))

## Hosting a static website using Amazon S3 & CloudFront
- You can use [Amazon S3 to host a static website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html).
- [On a static website, individual webpages include static content](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/CDNs/StaticContentWithCDN.md).
- They might also contain client-side scripts.

By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server-side processing, including server-side scripts, such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET.
- [Amazon S3]() does not support server-side scripting, but AWS has other resources for hosting dynamic websites.
