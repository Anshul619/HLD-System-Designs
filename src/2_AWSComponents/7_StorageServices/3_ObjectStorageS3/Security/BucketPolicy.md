# Bucket Policy
- A [bucket policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-policies.html) is a resource-based policy that you can use to grant access permissions to your Amazon S3 bucket and the objects in it.
- By default, [all Amazon S3 resources are private](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-policy.html), so only the AWS account that created the resources can access them.
