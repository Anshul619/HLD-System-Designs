# Volume Gateway
- [Volume Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/volume/) provides an iSCSI target, with which you can create block storage volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises or EC2 application servers.

| Cached Mode | The primary data is written to [Amazon S3](../../3_ObjectStorageS3/Readme.md), while retaining the frequently accessed data locally in a cache for low-latency access.<br/>- Local disks are needed for cache storage and an upload buffer for a cached volume gateway. | Custom file shares<br/>- Migrating application data into Amazon S3 and transitioning to Amazon EC2 |
| Stored mode | The primary data is stored locally and the entire dataset is available for low-latency access while asynchronously backed up to AWS.                                                                                                                                 | Block storage backups<br/>- Migrations or phased migrations<br/>- Cloud-based disaster recovery.   |
