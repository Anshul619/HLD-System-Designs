# Amazon EBS use cases

Amazon EBS is useful when you must retrieve data quickly and have data persist long-term. Volumes are commonly used in the following scenarios.

| Use Case                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :star: Databases                  | A storage layer for databases (like [Casandra](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/3_DatabaseComponents/NoSQL-Databases/ApacheCasandra.md), [MongoDB](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/3_DatabaseComponents/NoSQL-Databases/MongoDB/Readme.md), [Kafka](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/4_MessageBrokers/Kafka/Readme.md), [Hadoop](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/5_BigDataComponents/BatchProcessing/ApacheHadoop/Readme.md) etc.) running on [Amazon EC2](../../3_ComputeServices/AmazonEC2/Readme.md) that rely on transactional reads and writes. |
| Operating systems                 | Boot/root volumes to store an operating system. The root device for an instance launched from an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is typically an Amazon EBS volume. These are commonly referred to as EBS-backed AMIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Enterprise applications           | Amazon EBS provides reliable block storage to run business-critical applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Throughput-intensive applications | Applications that perform long, continuous reads and writes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Life-&-Shift                      | Lift and shift, self-managed database migrations are best suited for Amazon EBS. The EBS volumes are similar to running the application on dedicated servers on premises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

# Amazon EBS benefits

|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :star: Performance for any workload | Amazon EBS architecture is built for mission critical applications. <br/>- It delivers the right performance for the most demanding workloads.                         |
| High availability                   | When you create an EBS volume, it is automatically replicated in its Availability Zone to prevent data loss from single points of failure.                             |
| Data persistence                    | The storage persists even when your instance doesnt.                                                                                                                   |
| Data encryption                     | All EBS volumes support encryption.                                                                                                                                    |
| Flexibility                         | EBS volumes support on-the-fly changes. You can modify volume type, volume size, and input/output operations per second (IOPS) capacity without stopping your instance. |
| Backups through EBS Snapshots       | Amazon EBS provides the ability to create backups of any EBS volume, through snapshots.                                                                                |

| Avoid provisioning EBS volumes larger than required.              | AWS recommends that you start small and increase the volume sizes as required over time unless the application requires a static volume size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Avoid over-sizing provisioned performance options.                | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Use newer volume types when appropriate.                          | Newer volume types either offer lower base pricing or the capability to provision less capacity and still meet your performance goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Use lower-cost volume types when appropriate.                     | The [pricing is much lower for gp3 volumes than for io1 or io2 volumes](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/volume-types/) for both capacity and provisioned IOPS.<br/>- For workloads under 16,000 IOPS and under 1,000 MB/s, gp3 volumes offer a significant cost savings compared to older gp2 volumes, and compared to the high IOPS performance io1 and io2 volumes types. |
