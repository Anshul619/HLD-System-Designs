| Not preserved on [AMI creation](../../3_ComputeServices/AmazonEC2/AmazonMachineImages.md) | If you create an [AMI from an instance](../../3_ComputeServices/AmazonEC2/AmazonMachineImages.md), the data on its instance store volumes isn't preserved and isn't present on the instance store volumes of the instances that you [launch from the AMI](../../3_ComputeServices/AmazonEC2/AmazonMachineImages.md). |
