# Amazon EC2 instance store
- [Amazon EC2 instance store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html) provides temporary block-level storage for an instance. 
- This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. 
- This ties the lifecycle of the data to the lifecycle of the EC2 instance. 
- If you delete the instance, the instance store is deleted, as well. 
- Due to this, instance store is considered ephemeral storage.
