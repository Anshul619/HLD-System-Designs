- S3 is an object store, meaning it is a `higher layer data storage system`, essentially `it is a database "blob" storage`, storing data in an underlying `simple database as an object`.
- It's designed for `WRITE once READ many access`, perfect for `static website` or `media data like image, video, documents`.
- It's distributed and offers a very high level of redundancy ( like `data is stored in 3 AZs within a specific region` ).
- Amazon S3 also offers integrations to help prevent breaches by way of `PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, and FedRAMP`.
