# Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
- [Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html) is essentially [NAS as a service](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/nas/).
- It is a Network Storage system, underlying it is a storage array (SAN) and it offers the standard protocol for [multi session network file systems (NFS)](../Network-Protocol-Support.md).

| Concurrent operations by multiple [EC2 Instances](../../3_ComputeServices/AmazonEC2) | [EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html) is mainly designed for [multiple EC2 instances](../../3_ComputeServices/AmazonEC2) to access the files concurrently (which can't be done with [EBS](../1_BlockStorageTypes/AmazonEBS.md)).<br/>- Highly parallelized applications and workloads, such as big data analysis, media processing, and genomic analysis, can benefit from this mode. |
