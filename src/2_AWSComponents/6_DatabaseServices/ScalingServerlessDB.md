# Scaling serverless DB

| Mode                | [On-Demand](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html#HowItWorks.requests) | Provisioned                                                                                                  | Provisioned with AutoScaling                                                                   |

| Capacity Settings   | None                                                                                                                                    | Specify Read Capacity Units (RCU) and Write Capacity Units (WCU)                                             | Define lower and upper capacity limits & target utilization percentage                         |
| Scaling Behaviour   | Instantly handles up to double previous traffic peak                                                                                    | All Provisioned capacity is available                                                                        | Scales capacity to handle traffic increases and decreases maintaining target utilization.      |
| Throttling Behavior | Requests may be throttled if new peak is more than double previous within 30 minutes                                                    | Requests throttled if provisioned capacity is exceeded                                                       | Very short bursts may be throttled. Scales in response to changes in load testing in few mins. |
| Cost Consideration  | Set amount for each read and write. Able to evaluate cost per transaction.                                                              | Set rate for provisioned capacity. <br/>- Overall costs may be lower if you have steady, consistent traffic. | Same as Provisioned.                                                                           |
