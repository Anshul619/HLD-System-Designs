# DynamoDB Streams and AWS Lambda triggers
- [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.Lambda.html) is integrated with [AWS Lambda](../../3_ComputeServices/AWSLambda/Readme.md) so that you can create triggersâ€”pieces of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams. 
- With triggers, you can build applications that react to data modifications in DynamoDB tables.
