# Amazon DynamoDB
- [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a fully managed [NoSQL](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/3_DatabaseComponents) database service
- It is a key-value & document DB service, for fast lookup using primary key.
- Every record in a DynamoDB database can be considered as a map of attributes and values with a primary key to retrieve the record.
- All data items are stored on [Solid State Drives (SSDs)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/SSD-solid-state-drive), and are replicated across [3 Availability Zones](../../AWS-Global-Architecture-Region-AZ.md) for [high availability](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/Reliability/HighAvailability.md) and [durability](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/Database/Durability.md). 
- With DynamoDB, you can offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available distributed database cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.

## IoT sensor data capture architecture
- Capturing data from thousands of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can be a challenge. This architecture represents one solution to this challenge.

| Tables      | Similar to other database systems, DynamoDB stores data in tables. A table is a collection of data. <br/>- For instance, you could have a table called People that you could use to store personal contact information about friends, family, or anyone else of interest. <br/>- You could also have a Cars table to store information about vehicles that people drive.                                                                                                                                   |
| Items       | Each table contains zero or more items. <br/>- An item is a group of attributes that is uniquely identifiable among all the other items. <br/>- In a People table, each item represents a person. <br/>- In a Cars table, each item represents one vehicle. <br/>- Items in DynamoDB are similar in many ways to rows, records, or tuples in other database systems. <br/>- In DynamoDB, there is no limit to the number of items you can store in a table.                                                |
| Attributes  | Each item is composed of one or more attributes. <br/>- An attribute is a fundamental data element, something that does not need to be broken down any further. <br/>- For example, an item in a People table might contain attributes called PersonID, LastName, FirstName, and so on. <br/>- In a Department table, an item might have attributes such as DepartmentID, Name, Manager, and so on.<br/>-  Attributes in DynamoDB are similar in many ways to fields or columns in other database systems. |

# Data types supported in DynamoDB

DynamoDB supports a large set of data types for table attributes. 

| Data Type   | Description                                                                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scalar      | These types represent a single value, and include number, string, binary, Boolean, and null.        |
| Document    | These types represent a complex structure possessing nested attributes, and include lists and maps. |
| Set         | These types represent multiple scalars, and include string sets, number sets, and binary sets.      |

# :thumbsdown: What are disadvantages of DynamoDB?
- Deployable only on AWS and cannot be installed on individual desktops/servers
- No server side scripts
- General disadvantages of NoSQL
  - Querying data is extremely limited
  - Table Joins are impossible
  - No triggers
  - No foreign key concept to refer to other table items
