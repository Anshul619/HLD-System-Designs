| [RDS Custom for Oracle](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-rds-custom-for-oracle-new-control-capabilities-in-database-environment/) | With RDS Custom for Oracle, you can now access and customize your database server host and operating system, for example by applying special patches and changing the database software settings to support third-party applications that require privileged access.<br/>-  Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures, can have a large number of open connections to the database server and may open and close database connections at a high rate, exhausting database memory and compute resources.                                                                                                 |
