# How to connect your datacenter with VPC?
- A VPC is the best way of connecting to your cloud resources from your own data center.
- Once you connect your datacenter to the VPC in which your instances are present, each instance is assigned a private IP address that can be accessed from your data center.
- That way, you can access your public cloud resources as if they were on your own private network.
