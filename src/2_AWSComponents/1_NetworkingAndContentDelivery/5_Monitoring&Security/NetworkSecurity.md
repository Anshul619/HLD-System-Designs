# What is security monitoring?
- Security monitoring refers to security information monitoring (SIM) and security event monitoring (SEM).
- It is a process of collecting and analyzing information to detect suspicious behavior or unauthorized system changes on your network

# Security Controls

| Control           | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Directive         | Directive controls establish the governance, risk, and compliance models within which the environment operates.                                                            |
| Detective         | Detective controls are intended to identify and characterize an incident in progress and provide assistance during investigations and audits after the event has occurred. |
| Preventive        | Preventive controls are designed to prevent an incident from occurring.                                                                                                    |
| :star: Responsive | Responsive controls are intended to limit the extent of any damage caused by the incident.                                                                                 |


# Security Practices

| [Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing))        | Firewalls are a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.                                        |
| [Packet Analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer)      | A packet analyzer (or packet sniffer) is the standard tool for capturing packets.                                                   |
| [Penetration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) | Penetration testing software or penetration tools help in identifying security weaknesses in a network, server, or web application. |

# Types of Attack

| Attack                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                            | Examples                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Active Attack           | Active network attacks are often aggressive and people are immediately aware of the attack. <br/>- An active attack is one in which an unauthorized change of the system is attempted. | [Masquerade Attack](https://seon.io/resources/dictionary/masquerade-attack/), [DDOS Attack](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-denial-of-service-attack-dos) |
| Passive network attacks | Passive network attacks are when an attacker analyzes traffic and the content of packets.                                                                                              | Man-in-middle-attack                                                                                                                                                            |
