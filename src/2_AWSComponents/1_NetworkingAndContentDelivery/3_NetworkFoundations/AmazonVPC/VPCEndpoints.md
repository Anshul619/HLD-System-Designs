# VPC Endpoints
- A [VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-privatelink/what-are-vpc-endpoints.html) enables customers to privately connect to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by [AWS PrivateLink](../AWSPrivateLink.md).
- Endpoints are virtual devices that are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. 
- They allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.
- VPC endpoints enable you to reduce data transfer charges resulting from network communication between private VPC resources (such as Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute—or EC2—instances) and AWS Services (such as Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, or QLDB).

| Description                                        | A gateway that is a target for a specific route in your route table, used for traffic destined to a supported AWS service which is either [DynamoDB](../../../6_DatabaseServices/AmazonDynamoDB/Readme.md) or [S3](../../../7_StorageServices/3_ObjectStorageTypes/AmazonS3/Readme.md). | An elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported AWS service, endpoint service, or AWS Marketplace service. |
