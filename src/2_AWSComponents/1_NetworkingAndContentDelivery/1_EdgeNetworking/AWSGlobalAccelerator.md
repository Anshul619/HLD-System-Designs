| [Good Fit for UDP/TCP applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-benefits-of-migrating.html) | [Global Accelerator]() is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Performance Improvement with low-latency, increased throughput                                                                        | [Global Accelerator]() utilizes the Amazon global network, allowing you to improve the performance of your applications by lowering first-byte latency (the round trip time for a packet to go from a client to your endpoint and back again) and jitter (the variation of latency), and increasing throughput (the amount of time it takes to transfer data) as compared to the public internet.                                                                                         |
| [2 global static anycast customer-facing IPs](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/features/)                                    | [Global Accelerator]() provides two global static public IPs that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints, such as [Application Load Balancers](../2_ApplicationNetworking/ElasticLoadBalancer/Readme.md), [Network Load Balancers](../2_ApplicationNetworking/ElasticLoadBalancer/Readme.md), [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances](../../3_ComputeServices/AmazonEC2/Readme.md), and [elastic IPs](../../3_ComputeServices/AmazonEC2/Networking/ElasticIP.md). |
