# AWS CloudMap
- [AWS Cloud Map](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/) is a cloud resource discovery service. 
- With Cloud Map, you can define custom names for your application resources, and it maintains the updated location of these dynamically changing resources. 
- This increases your application availability because your web service always discovers the most up-to-date locations of its resources.
