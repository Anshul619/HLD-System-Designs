# [Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html)
- Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale.
- API Gateway allows you to create your APIs programmatically by importing Swagger definitions, using either the AWS API or the AWS Management Console. 
- API Gateway serves as a front door to any web application running on Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, AWS Lambda, or in any on-premises environment. 
- Basically, API Gateway allows you to run APIs without having to manage servers.
