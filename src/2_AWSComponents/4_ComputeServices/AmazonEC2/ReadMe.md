Follow these best practices to get the maximum benefit from burstable performance instances.
- Ensure that the instance size you choose passes the minimum memory requirements of your operating system and applications. Operating systems with graphical user interfaces that consume significant memory and CPU resources (for example, Windows) might require a t3.micro or larger instance size for many use cases. As the memory and CPU requirements of your workload grow over time, you have the flexibility with the T instances to scale to larger instance sizes of the same instance type, or to select another instance type.
- Enable [AWS Compute Optimizer](https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/getting-started/) for your account and review the Compute Optimizer recommendations for your workload. Compute Optimizer can help assess whether instances should be upsized to improve performance or downsized for cost savings.
