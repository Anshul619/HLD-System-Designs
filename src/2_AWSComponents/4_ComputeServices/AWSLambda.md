# AWS Lambda
- `Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.` 
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) runs your code on a [high-availability compute infrastructure](../../1_HLDDesignComponents/0_SystemGlossaries/HighAvailability.md) and performs all the administration of compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. 
- With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. 
- All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that Lambda supports.
