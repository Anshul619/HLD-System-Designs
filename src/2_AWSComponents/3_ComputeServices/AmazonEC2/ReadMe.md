Follow these best practices to get the maximum benefit from burstable performance instances.
- Ensure that the instance size you choose passes the minimum memory requirements of your operating system and applications. 
- Operating systems with graphical user interfaces that consume significant memory and CPU resources (for example, Windows) might require a t3.micro or larger instance size for many use cases. As the memory and CPU requirements of your workload grow over time, you have the flexibility with the T instances to scale to larger instance sizes of the same instance type, or to select another instance type.
- Enable [AWS Compute Optimizer](https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/getting-started/) for your account and review the Compute Optimizer recommendations for your workload. Compute Optimizer can help assess whether instances should be upsized to improve performance or downsized for cost savings.
- Enable [Instance Scheduler on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/instance-scheduler-on-aws/) to configure start and stop schedules for your Amazon EC2 and [Amazon RDS instances](../../6_DatabaseServices/AmazonRDS/Readme.md) to manage costs.
