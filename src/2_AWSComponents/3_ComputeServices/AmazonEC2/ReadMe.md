## Best Practices with burstable performance instances
- Ensure that the instance size you choose passes the minimum memory requirements of your operating system and applications. 
- Operating systems with graphical user interfaces that consume significant memory and CPU resources (for example, Windows) might require a t3.micro or larger instance size for many use cases. As the memory and CPU requirements of your workload grow over time, you have the flexibility with the T instances to scale to larger instance sizes of the same instance type, or to select another instance type.
- Enable [AWS Compute Optimizer](https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/getting-started/) for your account and review the Compute Optimizer recommendations for your workload. Compute Optimizer can help assess whether instances should be upsized to improve performance or downsized for cost savings.
- Enable [Instance Scheduler on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/instance-scheduler-on-aws/) to configure start and stop schedules for your Amazon EC2 and [Amazon RDS instances](../../6_DatabaseServices/AmazonRDS/Readme.md) to manage costs.

| [Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html)   | Packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of high-performance computing (HPC) applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Partition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) | Spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. <br/>- This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as [Hadoop](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/5_BigDataComponents/BatchProcessing/ApacheHadoop/Readme.md), [Cassandra](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/3_DatabaseComponents/NoSQL-Databases/ApacheCasandra.md), and [Kafka](../../../1_HLDDesignComponents/4_MessageBrokers/Kafka/Readme.md). |
| [Spread](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html)    | Strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
