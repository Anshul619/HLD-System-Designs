# Elastic Fabric Adapter
- An [Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/) is a network device that you can attach to your [Amazon EC2 instance](../Readme.md) to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications. 
- It enhances the performance of inter-instance communication that is critical for scaling HPC and machine learning applications. 
- EFA devices provide all [Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-network-adapter-high-performance-network-interface-for-amazon-ec2/) devices functionalities plus a new OS bypass hardware interface that allows user-space applications to communicate directly with the hardware-provided reliable transport functionality.
