# AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) deploys web applications so that you can focus on your business.
- With Elastic Beanstalk, developers upload their application. 
- Then, Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. 
- By using Elastic Beanstalk, developers can focus on developing their application and are freed from deployment-oriented tasks, such as provisioning servers, setting up load balancing, or managing scaling.
