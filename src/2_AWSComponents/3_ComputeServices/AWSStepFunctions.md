# AWS Step Functions
- [AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) is a serverless orchestration service that lets you integrate with [AWS Lambda](AWSLambda/Readme.md) functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications.

# General Use Cases

## Delay Lambda Functions for some time

## Handle Partial failure for a transaction in Microservices architecture
- In microservices architecture, step function can be helpful to handle partial failure for a business transaction like order placement,
- With distributed data stores, partial execution failures will happen and Step functions can be helpful to handle those.

# Scaling considerations for Step functions

| Use wait states and callbacks                                                                                                                  | Itâ€™s a best practice to use wait states and callbacks to reduce costs when you are waiting on other tasks to finish.                                                                                                                   |
| [Use timeouts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/sfn-stuck-execution.html)                                                  | You also want to use timeouts within Step Functions to avoid stuck executions                                                                                                                                                          |
| Use [Amazon S3](../7_StorageServices/AmazonS3/Readme.md) if payload has the potential to grow beyond the limit for input or output data size   | If your payload has the potential to grow beyond the limit for input or output data size, use [Amazon Simple Storge Service (Amazon S3)](../7_StorageServices/AmazonS3/Readme.md) to store the data and pass the ARN of the S3 bucket. |
| [Limit to StartExecution requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_StartExecution.html)                     | There is a limit to how many StartExecution requests can be made per second, and requests beyond that level will be throttled.                                                                                                         |
