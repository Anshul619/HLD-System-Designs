# GuardRails
- [Guardrails](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/amazon-sagemaker-with-guardrails/) are high-level rules that provide ongoing governance for your overall AWS environment.
- AWS provides additional security by using [AWS PrivateLink](../1_NetworkingAndContentDelivery/3_NetworkFoundations/AWSPrivateLink.md), [Amazon CloudWatch](../8_MonitoringServices/AmazonCloudWatch.md), [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](../2_SecurityAndIdentityServices/1_IdentityServices/AWSIAM/Readme.md), [AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](../2_SecurityAndIdentityServices/2_DataProtectionServices/AWSKMS.md), and other native services.
