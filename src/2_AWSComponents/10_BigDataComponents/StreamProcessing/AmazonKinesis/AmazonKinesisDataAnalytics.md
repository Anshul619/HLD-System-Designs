# Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics
- [Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-analytics/) is the easiest way to analyze streaming data in real-time. 
- Kinesis Data Analytics enables you to easily and quickly build queries and sophisticated streaming applications in three simple steps: setup your streaming data sources, write your queries or streaming applications, and set up your destination for processed data.
- Kinesis Data Analytics cannot directly ingest data from the source as it ingests data either from [Kinesis Data Streams](../../../5_MessageBrokerServices/AmazonKinesisDataStreams.md) or [Kinesis Data Firehose](AmazonKinesisDataFirehouse.md), so this option is ruled out.
