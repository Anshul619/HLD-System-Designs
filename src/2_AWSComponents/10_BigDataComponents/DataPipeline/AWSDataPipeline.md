# AWS Data Pipeline
- [AWS Data Pipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/) provides a managed orchestration service that gives you greater flexibility in terms of the execution environment, access and control over the compute resources that run your code, as well as the code itself that does data processing. 
- [AWS Data Pipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/) launches compute resources in your account allowing you direct access to the [Amazon EC2 instances](../../3_ComputeServices/AmazonEC2/Readme.md) or [Amazon EMR clusters](../BatchProcessing/ETL/AmazonEMR.md).
