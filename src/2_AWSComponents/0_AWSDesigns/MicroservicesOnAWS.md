## DNS-based service discovery
- [Amazon ECS](../4_ComputeServices/AmazonECS/README.md) now includes integrated service discovery that makes it easy for your containerized services to discover and connect with each other. 

## Asynchronous messaging and event passing
- [Amazon SQS](../5_MessageBrokerServices/AmazonSQS.md) and [Amazon SNS](../5_MessageBrokerServices/AmazonSNS.md) can be used for asynchronous messaging and event passing in microservices.
